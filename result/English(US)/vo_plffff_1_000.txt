Whoa!

Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo nooooooo

2.wav
Origin point of long-range lasers confirmed.

3.wav
11B, down.

4.wav
Our HO-229 cancellers are ineffective.

5.wav
7e down.

6.wav
Everything that lives is designed to end.

7.wav
We are perpetually trapped.

8.wav
in a never-ending spiral of life and death.

9.wav
Is this a curse?

10.wav
or some kind of punishment?

11.wav
I often think about the god who blessed us with this cryptic puzzle.

12.wav
and wonder if we'll ever have the chance to kill him.

13.wav
To be here, all units have penetrated the stratosphere.

14.wav
Autopilot systems green across the board.

15.wav
We've passed the 50 kilometer threshold and are proceeding toward the target.

16.wav
Understood.

17.wav
12H down.

18.wav
All units activate manual mode and rely on visuals to evade.

19.wav
Requesting permission to engage.

20.wav
1D down. Assuming Captain's duties.

21.wav
Multiple surrounding enemy air units confirmed. Requesting permission to assume mobile configuration.

22.wav
4B down.

23.wav
2B to operator 6-0.

24.wav
All allied units down.

25.wav
The operation is compromised, awaiting further orders.

26.wav
Understood.

27.wav
んっ

28.wav
9S

29.wav
Thank you.

30.wav
for uploading my data to the bunker.

31.wav
I see.

32.wav
I'm fine 9S. There's something about your voice that calms me.

33.wav
Captain, I think...

34.wav
So... mission complete and all that, huh?

35.wav
The Goliaths were wiped out and we secured a route into enemy territory. Now we can-

36.wav
Yeah?

37.wav
[Silent]

38.wav
Um, I did that? Sorry, I don't remember.

39.wav
There wasn't a whole lot of bandwidth down there, you know?

40.wav
I probably only had enough time to back up your memories.

41.wav
Mine are only intact up to the point just before we rendezvoused.

42.wav
Initializing Systems

43.wav
2B, can you hear me? I'm starting your boot sequence.

44.wav
Pull up the settings screen.

45.wav
First you'll want to check your brightness settings.

46.wav
Hmm? You don't know how to adjust the brightness? I think it's set up to respond to some kind of input.

47.wav
Eh, alright. Just give me a second here.

48.wav
Okay, I found the guide. If you can just follow that, it'll make things easier.

49.wav
Right then, let's get started.

50.wav
We'll go through each adjustment in order.

51.wav
Okay, how does this look?

52.wav
Roger that.

53.wav
Oh, and I should probably let you know that this entire process is being recorded for posterity.

54.wav
Now let's take a look at your voice recognition settings.

55.wav
Seems your voice recognition is set to mute, which isn't gonna work. I'm gonna call out to you now. Make sure you can hear my voice.

56.wav
Ma'am? Are you there? Can you hear me?

57.wav
Uh, hello? Go ahead and adjust your settings so you can hear me, alright?

58.wav
Adjust the settings until you can hear my voice.

59.wav
Uh, could you try and pick up the pace a little bit? This is getting embarrassing.

60.wav
Wait, you shouldn't be able to hear me now.

61.wav
Alright, are we good now?

62.wav
Okay, settings should all be good to go.

63.wav
Oh, uh... Thank you. Anyway, that takes care of the settings.

64.wav
What the heck? My pulse rate is rising.

65.wav
Hmm. It seems to be back to normal now. How odd.

66.wav
Hold on. Your self-destruct permissions are missing. Wait a sec, we need to restore those.

67.wav
I could set it for you, but you should probably do it yourself. Regulations and all, you know?

68.wav
Huh? Wait, no, you need to leave that turned on.

69.wav
Yeah, you can't really do that. It needs to be turned on except in very specific cases.

70.wav
I'm afraid I can't leave this as is, ma'am. Please give your permission.

71.wav
Hey, come on now. I'm just trying to follow regulations here.

72.wav
Okay, good. If things go wrong during an OP, you may have to sacrifice yourself in order to finish it, so...

73.wav
Once you're finished making adjustments, you can go ahead and close this out.

74.wav
Oh, I see you've turned vibration detection on. Let's run a check to make sure it's working.

75.wav
I'm gonna tap you on the shoulders, alright?

76.wav
How was that? Did you feel it?

77.wav
Okay, check complete.

78.wav
Huh? That's odd. Everything should be set up correctly.

79.wav
Here, let me try somewhere else. I'm gonna tap you on the arm this time, okay?

80.wav
Did you feel that?

81.wav
Okay, check complete.

82.wav
Huh? Really?

83.wav
Tooby must have felt that. Maybe she's just messing with me.

84.wav
Well, if you say so... How about this?

85.wav
Should I tap her here though? She might get angry at me.

86.wav
Uh, how was that?

87.wav
Okay, check complete.

88.wav
Are you serious?

89.wav
You didn't feel anything just now?

90.wav
Well then, let's try something else.

91.wav
No turning back now, I guess.

92.wav
Well...

93.wav
Okay, great. Thanks.

94.wav
Hmm. I don't know what's causing this, so we'll need to run some precision diagnostics later.

95.wav
Regardless, that's the end of the check for now.

96.wav
I know no one likes the idea of self-destructing.

97.wav
but that's what regulations call for. Still, I'll keep it a secret from the commander.

98.wav
You don't want to hear my voice? I mean, it's your choice and all, but...

99.wav
You undid the settings I walked you through.

100.wav
Uh... this isn't about me, is it? Because I'm really hoping we'll be a good team going forward.

101.wav
Heh. Ma'am, you fiddled with so many things, I ended up hitting my Mac's storage limit. I'll have to stop recording for now.

102.wav
This is command. Yorha squadron, come in.

103.wav
This is operator 6-0. All units confirmed.

104.wav
Understood. Once you reach their anti-air defenses, proceed to manual attack formation.

105.wav
then destroy the Goliath class unit by any means necessary and gather what data you can.

106.wav
Permission granted.

107.wav
Permission granted.

108.wav
Uh, Operator to 2B.

109.wav
We need you to rendezvous with Unit 9S and begin gathering data on the local terrain.

110.wav
Already engaged. Free movement unlocked.

111.wav
Alert! Enemy unit sighted ahead.
