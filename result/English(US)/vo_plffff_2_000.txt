Is that our target?

1.wav
You don't say.

2.wav
Copy that.

3.wav
No, just another defensive system.

4.wav
Alright, I'll work my way inside from the ground.

5.wav
I know.

6.wav
What is it?

7.wav
Do it.

8.wav
So open it.

9.wav
Nothing's ever easy.

10.wav
Why?

11.wav
Emotions are prohibited.

12.wav
and another thing.

13.wav
Stop calling me ma'am.

14.wav
It's unnecessary.

15.wav
This place sure is big.

16.wav
So if we don't destroy it, they'll just keep coming.

17.wav
What?

18.wav
That city.

19.wav
No.

20.wav
Is that?

21.wav
I surveyed the entire factory, but couldn't find anything resembling our target.

22.wav
ふむ

23.wav
I wouldn't bet on that.

24.wav
Doesn't matter. I'll just take him out.

25.wav
This is the target. I'm going to destroy it.

26.wav
9S!

27.wav
I'm going after him!

28.wav
Send a support request to command.

29.wav
I have to help 9S.

30.wav
It talks? I didn't know the machines had that kind of intelligence.

31.wav
I told you to shut up!

32.wav
Seize its control system!

33.wav
Got it.

34.wav
You're 2B, right?

35.wav
My name's 9S. I'm here to provide support.

36.wav
So, was that big ol' buzzsaw the Goliath you came here to take out?

37.wav
Oh, well, uh, I guess we have to find the target then, huh?

38.wav
I've got a flight unit, so I'll take a look around the perimeter.

39.wav
To be... a... man?

40.wav
I was going to send you the map data I collected earlier.

41.wav
You know ma'am, I'm glad you're here.

42.wav
Scanners like me mostly work alone, scouting out enemy lines and all that.

43.wav
I don't usually get a partner. It's kinda fun!

44.wav
Sorry, ma'am.

45.wav
Huh?

46.wav
Alright then, 2B it is.

47.wav
I guess humans used to use it as a weapons factory.

48.wav
But now it's just crawling with machines.

49.wav
The enemy seems to have repurposed the facility to increase their overall machine production.

50.wav
It's just accessing random, nonsensical data from the old world.

51.wav
There's no actual meaning behind anything machines do.

52.wav
Ah, yeah. Lots of humans used to live over there.

53.wav
Is this your first time seeing it?

54.wav
You mean the birds?

55.wav
Yeah, there's more plants and animals here than there used to be. Probably because the environment's changed.

56.wav
Yeah, I didn't find anything either.

57.wav
Maybe they... I don't know, moved it somewhere?

58.wav
There should be another facility across that bridge.

59.wav
It's a bit of a hike, but should we check it out?

60.wav
It's not like command to get a location wrong. I guess even they get bad intel from time to time, huh?

61.wav
What's your status?

62.wav
Uh, right. I'll provide support.

63.wav
I'll hack this thing and weaken it!

64.wav
Hacking in!

65.wav
to be. I found a weakness in the target.

66.wav
hacking in... to provide support.

67.wav
to be the control on the enemy's upper arm.

68.wav
You should pod... should be able to... take it over...

69.wav
Control of upper arm... seized from enemy unit.

70.wav
Marking weak point.

71.wav
HELLO? HELLO? HELLO? HELLO? HELLO?
