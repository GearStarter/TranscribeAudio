Because you made it this far, we have a special announcement just for you.

2.wav
Because you made it this far, we have a special announcement just for you.

Because you made it this far, we have a special announcement just for you.

4.wav
Because you made it this far, we have a special announcement just for you.

5.wav
Because you made it this far, we have a special announcement just for you.

6.wav
Because you made it this far. We have a special announcement just for you.

7.wav
We'll reveal it, once you destroy all the machine lifeforms here.

8.wav
You did it!

9.wav
You did it.

10.wav
Now let us show you what we promised.

11.wav
We are conceptual human personalities, created within the machine network.

12.wav
We cannot be destroyed.

13.wav
Yorra Unit 9S

14.wav
Your attack is meaningless.

15.wav
Your existence is meaningless.

16.wav
hahahah growing poder

17.wav
Hey! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

18.wav
Ha ha ha ha ha!

19.wav
Thanks for watching!

20.wav
HAHAHAHAHAHA

21.wav
HA HA HA HA!

22.wav
KILL! KILL!

23.wav
Fucking stupid, you had to kill me

24.wav
HAHAHAHAHAHA!

25.wav
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!

26.wav
Hahahaha

27.wav
HAHAHAHAHAHA

28.wav
HA HA HA HA<|jw|>

29.wav
Yeah!

30.wav
OOAAHHH DHAHAHAHAHA

31.wav
Oh

32.wav
Good to see you again, Number Two.

33.wav
Or should we call you A2 now?

34.wav
This does bring back memories.

35.wav
Though to concepts like us, time has little meaning.

36.wav
Still, when we wiped out your forces, it made quite the impression on us.

37.wav
Yoraha Attacker Model Number 2

38.wav
An experimental disposable group, created as a test lab for Project Yorha.

39.wav
You're an obstinate little android, aren't you?

40.wav
Didn't we say that you can't kill us?

41.wav
It's also very amusing.

42.wav
The androids the human race left behind acted as if they wanted to be human.

43.wav
The machine life forms the aliens left behind act as if they wanted to be human.

44.wav
We resemble each other so, but we are networked and thus we are superior to you.

45.wav
Foolish androids, why do you resist?

46.wav
All things end with accepting death, do they not?

47.wav
We are one, and yet we are many.

48.wav
We are finite, and yet we are infinite.

49.wav
We are the embodiment of the perfect being.

50.wav
Ah, I see it. The light!

51.wav
We move on... Forward... To the future.

52.wav
Hey, how's it hanging?

53.wav
Your commander told me to build a new access point, so... Here you go.

54.wav
Oh, and I got the stupid transporter up and running too.

55.wav
I've known the Commander for a while now. She sure is good at punning work off on people.

56.wav
Next time you see her, give her some lip for me, will ya?

57.wav
Look, I care what you think, jerk.

58.wav
Here, follow me.

59.wav
Alright, see that jerk over there?

60.wav
I need you to get combat data for him.

61.wav
Science will pay you back for this, I promise. Now, fight!

62.wav
The Council of Humanity has a message for all of our brave androids fighting on the surface.

63.wav
Currently, our struggle against the machine lifeforms is at a stalemate.

64.wav
This battle has raged for far too long. I am sure all of you find the effort grueling.

65.wav
But now is not the time to give up. Now, more than ever, we must forge on.

66.wav
Remember that several hundred thousand humans on the moon want nothing more than to return to Earth.

67.wav
Glory to mankind.

68.wav
The Council of Humanity has a message for all of our brave androids fighting on the surface.

69.wav
Our elite Yorha forces, the pride of humanity, have defeated two enemy network units known as Adam and Eve.

70.wav
This victory is a giant leap forward in our quest to reclaim Earth.

71.wav
The moon rings out with the cheers of the entire human race.

72.wav
We look forward to your continued combat exploits.

73.wav
Glory to mankind.

74.wav
The Council of Humanity has a message for all of our brave androids fighting on the surface.

75.wav
It has been several millennia since the aliens and their advance force, the machine lifeforms, attacked us.

76.wav
Millennia since mankind was forced to evacuate to the surface of the moon

77.wav
But thanks to your continued struggle, we have been able to survive.

78.wav
You, our android soldiers, are the last hope of humanity.

79.wav
We look forward to your continued success in combat.

80.wav
Glory to mankind.

81.wav
The Council of Humanity has a message for all of our heroes fighting on the surface.

82.wav
Today, I have wonderful...

83.wav
The Council of Humanity has decided to increase the production of these animals.

84.wav
This will enable us to deal a powerful blow to our hidden enemies.

85.wav
The light of hope is near, and closer than ever to it.

86.wav
We look forward to future glory in the future, and know that you will be the ones to bring it to us.

87.wav
Glory to mankind.

88.wav
Not right, number two. We're all here... chose to be here.

89.wav
Thank you for giving meaning to my life.

90.wav
The operation is currently proceeding more smoothly than expected.

91.wav
Operator to 11B, report back about the machine life forms in your area.

92.wav
Supply Squadron has arrived on site and is ready to initiate distribution.

93.wav
8B Squadron has annihilated the enemy.

94.wav
Is everything alright? Okay, then I'll send you new location data, so head on over.

95.wav
Resistance forces have reported that the operation is proceeding apace.

96.wav
We can win if we keep this up.

97.wav
Goliath confirmed destroyed. 4B Squadron has emerged victorious.

98.wav
Operator 210 to Unit 9S, come in 9S.

99.wav
The Yorha troops have commenced their descent.

100.wav
Disable the enemy base's defense systems immediately.

101.wav
We'll need you to take down the enemy's defense systems to give our attack squadron a chance.

102.wav
You have four targets that need to be hacked.

103.wav
Be advised that hostiles have been detected around each target and must be defeated before continuing.

104.wav
The target is now accessible.

105.wav
One affirmation will suffice.

106.wav
Hacking complete. Proceed to the next target.

107.wav
Hacking complete. Two targets remain.

108.wav
Hacking complete. One target remains.

109.wav
May I remind you that personal chatter during operations is restricted?

110.wav
Hacking of enemy defense system complete.

111.wav
Our attack squadron can now infiltrate the base.

112.wav
You are to continue providing support by whatever means available.

113.wav
Yorha has entered the base.

114.wav
However, there is only one unit remaining.

115.wav
The enemy's defensive weapon is making things more difficult than we estimated.

116.wav
Operator to 9S

117.wav
Transferring coordinate data for the location specified by resistance leader.

118.wav
Mindless chatter drains Energy 9S.

119.wav
Please keep your comments reserved for mission-related topics.

120.wav
I read you 9S. Go ahead.

121.wav
Understood. Ready to receive.

122.wav
Operator to 9S. Data upload complete.

123.wav
I also have an incoming message from the Commander.

124.wav
Operator to 9S.

125.wav
I have an incoming message for 2B and 9S from the commander.

126.wav
Initiating playback.

127.wav
End transmission.

128.wav
Operator to 9S. Emergency transmission incoming.

129.wav
We've detected a Goliath-class enemy inside the city ruins.

130.wav
It seems to be accompanied by a large number of machine life forms.

131.wav
All YORHHA members are ordered to engage at once.

132.wav
Operator 210 here, do you read me?

133.wav
Operator to 9S, I have bad news and I have good news.

134.wav
Bad first, we've confirmed the presence of two Goliath-class heavy weapon enemies.

135.wav
Now the good news.

136.wav
We've used your previous Goliath combat data to analyze the enemy.

137.wav
And it seems we have identified a weakness.

138.wav
Command has modified a firing unit based on this new Intel.

139.wav
It's been installed on a pair of flight units that are heading your way.

140.wav
Check your map data. Operator out.

141.wav
Enemy anti-air defenses are on patrol at higher altitudes.

142.wav
A low-altitude approach is recommended.

143.wav
Roger that 9S.

144.wav
Operator 210 to 9S.

145.wav
Command has decided to stage a direct satellite laser strike on the hostile.

146.wav
We need you to destroy the enemy EMP generator so we can lock onto the target.

147.wav
Sending the coordinates to your map now.

148.wav
Confirmed elimination of electromagnetic interference.

149.wav
Stand by for incoming satellite laser strike.

150.wav
Ah, 9S.

151.wav
We recently detected large numbers of machine life forms throughout the factory area.

152.wav
We received a support request from 2B soon thereafter, but have been unable to respond due to poor reception.

153.wav
And those are your orders. Do you understand?

154.wav
The target is thought to be in a high location with good network reception. Try examining the rooftops of buildings.

155.wav
Please refrain from destroying the target. If you do, another one will simply take its place.

156.wav
That's right. Good job 9S.

157.wav
Be advised, the target's appearance is identical to that of a standard enemy. Once you approach, however, a marker will appear.

158.wav
What? That must be your imagination.

159.wav
Look for machines that are receiving signals from the anti-air system.

160.wav
You destroyed it again.

161.wav
They should be located in elevated areas with good signal reception.

162.wav
You have to hack them! Hack, hack, hack! They'll substitute another enemy soon, so try again.

163.wav
I forwarded the general positions of the machine life forms you need to hack.

164.wav
I see your hacking was successful. Way to go!

165.wav
Unit 9S, your orders are to hack into enemy units, not destroy them.

166.wav
Destroyed units will simply be replaced. Attacking is pointless.

167.wav
Now move on to the next one.

168.wav
Try to sneak up behind your foes, keep out of sight, and then...

169.wav
Boom! Hack em' up good.

170.wav
Defensive system operation confirmed to be declining.

171.wav
Enemy defense system fully offline. I knew you could do it.

172.wav
Looks like it's going well down there.

173.wav
Every scanner in the force is involved in this operation.

174.wav
That really was brilliant work, which means I've got a special surprise for you.

175.wav
So let's try not to fall behind.

176.wav
I'll leave it in my room so you can pick it up later.

177.wav
9S

178.wav
Make sure to do whatever is necessary to avoid combat.

179.wav
Scanner units such as yourself are not designed for battle.

180.wav
No, I'm merely pointing out that you would be a liability on the battlefield.

181.wav
A family to be with.

182.wav
はーはーはー especial

183.wav
Coordinate data... Location specified...

184.wav
Please keep... Reserved... Mission related...

185.wav
One... Affirmation... Well, well, well... Suffice...

186.wav
Please... Kill...

187.wav
I... just... want a family...

188.wav
I was so lonely.

189.wav
I want it to be... with my dress...

190.wav
According to our records, that material can be obtained from the bodies of large bipedal machine life forms.

191.wav
Why are you looking for... Well, anyway, you can salvage the requested material from smaller machine life forms.

192.wav
Finding one intact might prove tricky, however. The part is easily damaged when the machine housing it is destroyed.

193.wav
Operator to 9S.

194.wav
I will now relay the materials necessary to improve the network environment.

195.wav
You need to acquire a rusty bolt, a small gear, and a spring.

196.wav
You should be able to find them on small sized enemies.

197.wav
Once you have the materials, bring them to Anemone, the leader of the resistance.

198.wav
Gotcha is not an approved form of radio engagement 9S. Operator 210 out.

199.wav
Operator 210 to 9S.

200.wav
I've confirmed that you have the necessary parts to improve our network environment.

201.wav
Take the materials to anemone in the resistance camp. Operator 210 out.

202.wav
Operator 210 to 9S, come in.

203.wav
I received the data you sent.

204.wav
It's fascinating.

205.wav
It appears to be the journal of a human who once worked in the factory.

206.wav
Yes. According to this, the man worked long hours on an almost daily basis.

207.wav
He says, and I quote, they're working me like a machine.

208.wav
Working like a machine to build a machine? Humans truly were strange creatures.

209.wav
I'll send you a reward later.

210.wav
I didn't say you would not get a reward.

211.wav
Operator 210 to 9S. Come in 9S.

212.wav
I've sent you a new data retrieval request. Please read it.

213.wav
Over.

214.wav
Operator 210 to 9S.

215.wav
I've received your data.

216.wav
That depends on what I do with it.

217.wav
It is, however, fascinating.

218.wav
I was aware that humans used to live in groups.

219.wav
But I did not know they coexisted in such a wide variety of ways.

220.wav
I'm sure you're aware that most humans subsisted in small familial units.

221.wav
A family is a group of people that share a connection by blood or social custom.

222.wav
If androids had a similar system of families...

223.wav
うっ

224.wav
I've said too much.

225.wav
I must return to my duties.

226.wav
I have additional information to relate.

227.wav
I've sent mail with a reward. Please read it.

228.wav
And 9S, thank you.

229.wav
Operator 210 to 9S, be aware that the following transmission is classified privilege level 5.

230.wav
A group of Yorha fighters deployed to the city ruins have deserted. We need you to take care of them immediately.

231.wav
And 9S, be careful.

232.wav
Operator 210 here. Go ahead.

233.wav
Copy that 9S. We've confirmed their status on this end.

234.wav
I lack access to the data concerning this mission.

235.wav
The order came from the commander herself.

236.wav
Be careful 9S.

237.wav
I have no further information.

238.wav
Operator 210 to 9S. This is your regularly scheduled contact.

239.wav
Nothing to report. Copy that.

240.wav
And no need for a weather report. Operator 210 out.

241.wav
Operator 210 to 9S, this is your regularly scheduled contact.

242.wav
I have something important to discuss with you today.

243.wav
Our maintenance team filed a complaint about how you treat your flight unit.

244.wav
They requested that you cease making unauthorized modifications.

245.wav
If you have a rebuttal, you need to discuss it with maintenance. Fight it out if you must.

246.wav
Operator 2 1 0, out.

247.wav
Operator 210 to 9S, this is your regularly scheduled contact.

248.wav
Copy that. I also need to inform you that the Commander offers her personal praise for your recent achievements.

249.wav
As a direct result, we are currently considering boosting production of your model.

250.wav
Flattery is unnecessary.

251.wav
Operator 210 out.

252.wav
2B, you're going to have some new weaponry installed from here on out.

253.wav
I'll put up instructions for you. Make sure to commit them to memory.

254.wav
Bunker to 2B, come in.

255.wav
I've set a landing point for your flight units.

256.wav
You'll be touching down quite a ways from the resistance camp, unfortunately.

257.wav
Sorry for the trouble, but we can't risk the enemy discovering their position.

258.wav
Good luck down there.

259.wav
Understood, 042.

260.wav
placing marker on target.

261.wav
The desert heat is going to make resupply efforts difficult to be.

262.wav
Please make sure you're ready before you go.

263.wav
2B, this is an emergency transmission from the bunker.

264.wav
We're reading a Goliath class enemy inside the city ruins.

265.wav
And it looks like there are a ton of other machines there with it.

266.wav
All YoRHa units should proceed and engage immediately.

267.wav
Be careful, the skies are packed with anti-air weapons.

268.wav
Make sure to approach at low altitude.

269.wav
2B, this is operator 6-0.

270.wav
We now have an operational transporter in the city ruins.

271.wav
We're attempting to deploy them at other points as well.

272.wav
2B, command is attempting to launch a satellite laser strike on your target.

273.wav
But the enemy's electromagnetic camouflage is making it impossible to aim.

274.wav
We need you to find the emitter and take it out.

275.wav
I know, I know, but it's the only way.

276.wav
Electromagnetic interference eliminated.

277.wav
Preparing for satellite laser strike.

278.wav
Operator to 2B? 2B, are you alright?

279.wav
Thank goodness!

280.wav
Roger that.

281.wav
in regards to the giant machine that attacked the shore.

282.wav
It ceased its resistance eight hours ago following your missile strike.

283.wav
However, it's EMP strikes knocked out comms all across the region.

284.wav
We're having trouble getting them back online.

285.wav
which means data uploading is currently unavailable in some areas.

286.wav
Um... yeah, about that.

287.wav
We picked up a faint black box reading, but it wasn't strong enough to lock down his position.

288.wav
Actually, the commander has already ordered us to prioritize tracking down surviving YORHHA members.

289.wav
If you find 9S, let me know, okay?

290.wav
Oh, hey, Tooby. Roger that.

291.wav
Gimme just a second here.

292.wav
Operator here. What was that, 2B?

293.wav
2B, the operation will begin at a point southwest of the city ruins.

294.wav
Use your flight unit to travel there and meet up with 9S.

295.wav
We've repaired and reinstalled the weapons damaged in the fight against Eve.

296.wav
Be careful, okay? The mission will be in full swing by the time you get there.

297.wav
2B, we've sighted new enemies in the region.

298.wav
They've got Attack Squadron Omega surrounded and are giving them one hell of a fight!

299.wav
Can you get over there and provide support ASAP?

300.wav
De- Richard... I-Ross!!

301.wav
F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F...

302.wav
Ooh, bingo again!

303.wav
We are your beloved- Hehehehe, she likes worms!

304.wav
We speak to you through the network and the virus.

305.wav
We've had a great deal of fun watching you squirm.

306.wav
But I'm afraid the end has come for this outpost.

307.wav
Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha!

308.wav
Hahahaha! Hahahaha! Hahahaha!

309.wav
2B, I am operator 6-0.

310.wav
Thank you for... For the flowers!

311.wav
Desert flowers are beautif- Aren't they? Th-th-thank you! Someday I-

312.wav
Oh, this is so much fu-fu-fun! The virus we planted has blossomed into a beautiful flower!

313.wav
The virus we planted has blossomed into a beautiful flower!

314.wav
Operator to 2B. Come in 2B.

315.wav
We need you to collect the materials required to improve the network environment.

316.wav
You're going to need a rusty bolt, a small gear, and a spring.

317.wav
You should be able to find them on small sized enemies.

318.wav
Once you have everything, please take it to the resistance leader Anemone.

319.wav
I know it's a bit of a pain, but good luck!

320.wav
Operator 6-0 to 2-B.

321.wav
Looks like you found all the necessary parts to improve our network environment. Nice work!

322.wav
You can conclude your mission by bringing everything over to Anemone.

323.wav
Copy that. Good work.

324.wav
Aw, she's not so bad.

325.wav
Totally serious! The commander actually lets a lot of things slide on the side.

326.wav
Like, did you know that she leaves piles of clothes strewn everywhere? The cleaning team is so sick of it.

327.wav
Oh, and she never performs regular maintenance on herself.

328.wav
A lot of the hard-ass nature you mention is just for show.

329.wav
I can't tell you that.

330.wav
Operator 6L, out.

331.wav
Operator 6-0 to 2-B. Come in, 2-B.

332.wav
The monitoring signal from the new access point has gone silent.

333.wav
I'm sending you the positional data. Please investigate the site as soon as possible.

334.wav
Operator 6-0 to 2-B. Come in, 2-B.

335.wav
It looks like the transporter we installed in the city ruins has gone offline.

336.wav
Our surface activity is going to be severely limited until we get it fixed.

337.wav
Can you head over there and get it working again when you have a sec?

338.wav
Thanks, Tooby. Sending the details now.

339.wav
Oh hello, 2B. Operator 6-0 here.

340.wav
Looks green on my end, Tooby. Nice work.

341.wav
I'll let Command know right away.

342.wav
I'll also be sending over a little reward for all your hard work.

343.wav
You know, 2B, I'm a little jealous.

344.wav
Don't get me wrong, I know all this fighting isn't easy for you.

345.wav
But you get to see all these new and amazing things out there.

346.wav
It just... it might be nice to visit the surface sometime, you know? That's all.

347.wav
Uh, right. Apologies for the unnecessary chatter.

348.wav
Anyway, Operator Six-O out.

349.wav
2B, this is operator 6-0. Pick up!

350.wav
Thank you so much for the picture!

351.wav
So this is a desert rose, huh? It seems almost...mystical.

352.wav
There must just be a bounty of nature down there, huh?

353.wav
Oh, 2B...

354.wav
I'm going to treasure this forever.

355.wav
Oh, and I'm going to send you a proper thank you mail later, so keep an eye out for it. Bye!

356.wav
Operator 60 to 2B. Be aware that the following transmission is classified privilege level 5.

357.wav
A group of Yorha fighters deployed to the city ruins have deserted. We need you to take care of them immediately.

358.wav
But don't get yourself hurt, alright?

359.wav
Operator 6-0 to 2-B. It is time for your regularly scheduled contact.

360.wav
Good to hear. Say, how's the weather on Earth today? Good?

361.wav
Not really. I just figured it might feel nice to have some good weather.

362.wav
That is so like you to be

363.wav
Anyway, talk to you later!

364.wav
Operator 602B? Time for your regularly scheduled contact

365.wav
Oh, there's this operator I kind of liked, but when I asked her out, she turned me down.

366.wav
Honestly, Tooby, I don't know how I'm supposed to go on living.

367.wav
I don't think I can stand spending one more day in this bunker.

368.wav
Are you saying you need me to be?

369.wav
Toopie?

370.wav
Operator 6-0 to 2-B. It is time for your regularly scheduled contact.

371.wav
Listen, Tubi. I was looking at images of flowers today and-

372.wav
Yeah, there wasn't much left in the bunker's records, but I found one called a Lunar Tear.

373.wav
I bet you'd look really nice if you put one of those in your hair, Tooby. It'd suit your stylish looks.

374.wav
Aww, don't be a stick in the mud. What kind of girl doesn't want to look good sometimes?

375.wav
I'll let you know if I find anything else cute, okay?

376.wav
Operator 6-0 out.

377.wav
Bunker to 2B.

378.wav
We've got a number of broken down access points on the field.

379.wav
The cause appears to be an EMP attack from a gigantic machine life form.

380.wav
If you encounter any offline access points, please repair them for us.

381.wav
Hello?

382.wav
Before we begin, there's something you must understand.

383.wav
We are not your enemies.

384.wav
I understand that you see us as the enemy, but...

385.wav
Well anyway, my name is Pascal. I'm the leader of this village.

386.wav
Those who reside here desire nothing more than to live a peaceful existence.

387.wav
Look around for yourself. You'll see that it's true.

388.wav
Well, what do you think?

389.wav
Now do you believe we're not a threat?

390.wav
I suppose that's technically accurate.

391.wav
Yes, well, you're free to visit our village whenever you like.

392.wav
After all, the only way to understand someone is to get to know them. Isn't that right?

393.wav
I promise you, we were not aware of this information.

394.wav
I realize the odds of you believing me are strikingly low.

395.wav
But I hope you will nonetheless.

396.wav
Oh, it's 9S and 2B, yes?

397.wav
Those machines cost quite the ruckus, don't you think?

398.wav
Of course. I'll help however I can.

399.wav
2B...9S

400.wav
My apologies. We are machines, you know.

401.wav
But now that I'm here, what do you think?

402.wav
Have we convinced you that we desire peace?

403.wav
Kinda... Hmm... I suppose that's a start.

404.wav
Yes, Tooby?

405.wav
Hmm

406.wav
I suppose that unpleasant songstress you so kindly defeated in the amusement park wasn't part of the network.

407.wav
Oh, and of course there's the forest kingdom, but...

408.wav
Yes, it's a vast woodland area not far from here.

409.wav
There's a group of machines there attempting to build a nation of sorts.

410.wav
They're quite hostile to outsiders, however. We can't so much as go near the place.

411.wav
Northeast of the city ruins.

412.wav
You should be able to reach it by passing through the ruins of the commercial facility.

413.wav
If you go, however, be careful. Things have been rather rough there lately.

414.wav
Oh, you survived! How wonderful!

415.wav
Of course, anything.

416.wav
Hmm... Understood.

417.wav
I'll open the gate we built to deter enemy invaders.

418.wav
you'll be able to reach the village through there.

419.wav
I'm surprised you wish to speak with me personally. Whatever is the matter?

420.wav
I see.

421.wav
Information about this A2 Android is indeed contained within our archives.

422.wav
We all understand her to be rather dangerous.

423.wav
However, she's never visited our village in person.

424.wav
My apologies. That's all the information I have.

425.wav
That enormous machine is an ancient weapon.

426.wav
It was designed to help annihilate the androids, but it wound up going out of control.

427.wav
I was part of the machine's network when it happened, so I remember it.

428.wav
The moment it reached land, it went berserk and began attacking everything in sight.

429.wav
No one could figure out how to stop it.

430.wav
We eventually marooned it deep in the ocean, but it seems to be searching for a way back.

431.wav
Where are you going, Tooby? The machine lifeforms wishing to form an alliance are in the abandoned factory!

432.wav
Oh, hello 2B. Do you need something?

433.wav
New... trends? Hmm...

434.wav
Well, two days ago I was contacted by some machines that disconnected themselves from the network.

435.wav
They wanted to discuss a peace treaty.

436.wav
Apparently, they're seeking to form an alliance of some kind with our village.

437.wav
I believe they're working on building a colony of their own.

438.wav
Indeed. Apparently it's located in the abandoned factory.

439.wav
I can give you the coordinates if you'd like.

440.wav
I was actually planning to go speak with them myself, you know.

441.wav
Maybe we can meet up over there?

442.wav
O2B, hello.

443.wav
Are you ready to go?

444.wav
The machines who seek to form an alliance with my village are hiding out here.

445.wav
Still, you should probably be careful.

446.wav
We machines can be rather unpredictable.

447.wav
In truth, yes.

448.wav
Now that we're cut off from the network, we no longer share data with each other.

449.wav
We can speak, of course, but I find that language contains many ways to hide one's true intentions.

450.wav
This all seems pretty shady if you ask me.

451.wav
Well, I brought you this far, didn't I?

452.wav
Please, you must be calm. We have come to negotiate peace with you.

453.wav
It's my duty to see this through to the end.

454.wav
We should at least hear them out.

455.wav
Um, hello? My name is Pascal.

456.wav
I'm here to discuss the... Peace Treaty?

457.wav
2B, the elevator at the back of the room is open!

458.wav
I was right. This is Shady!

459.wav
Fascinating, though.

460.wav
I've never seen machines with such unique perspectives.

461.wav
I wonder if there's a way to collect some samples and-

462.wav
Uh, Tooby? Just so I'm clear, you aren't planning to leave me here, are you?

463.wav
Tooby, the door on the other side of the room just opened.

464.wav
Let's check it out!

465.wav
Well, that was certainly something!

466.wav
I had no idea such a vast space existed beneath the abandoned factory!

467.wav
I need to return and investigate as soon as possible.

468.wav
When I do, perhaps you'd be willing to join me?

469.wav
Oh, I'll probably wander back to the village. I have plenty on my plate there.

470.wav
Tooby?

471.wav
Tooby, can you hear me?

472.wav
Our village is under-

473.wav
Ha!

474.wav
9S

475.wav
It seems the machines on the network have gone berserk.

476.wav
We've sealed off the entrance to the village and are trying to hold them off, but-

477.wav
With these weapons, there's only so much we can do.

478.wav
You saved us! Oh, thank you so much!

479.wav
The machines on the network all webreserk at the same moment.

480.wav
I think the unit presiding over them may have gone mad.

481.wav
Most likely, yes.

482.wav
Do be careful.

483.wav
Hmm.

484.wav
Where the states ceaseeth, there only commenceth the man who is not superfluous.

485.wav
Hmm... I see.

486.wav
It seems this Nietzsche was quite the profound thinker.

487.wav
Or perhaps he skipped right past profound and went straight to crazy instead.

488.wav
Oh well, enough of that.

489.wav
I'd best go see the world for myself instead of burying my head in books.

490.wav
Well, look at you! Your speaking has improved so much!

491.wav
But I fear you still haven't finished your studies, have you?

492.wav
You promised to read and memorize that botanical field guide, remember?

493.wav
Of course I will. You have my word.

494.wav
And Uncle Pascal would never lie and break his word.

495.wav
Because children who lie grow up to be mean, evil machines!

496.wav
Hmm? What's that?

497.wav
A2, can you hear me?

498.wav
Help, A2! The village is in great trouble!

499.wav
The villagers are... OH NO!

500.wav
Ah! I hate you!

501.wav
I don't know!

502.wav
Some of the villagers suddenly went mad!

503.wav
They began attacking their friends!

504.wav
I managed to help the children flee to safety!

505.wav
But I fear everyone else is.

506.wav
But what about you?

507.wav
Right!

508.wav
Oh, hey too!

509.wav
How is my village? My people!

510.wav
Oh no.

511.wav
I've taken them to the abandoned factory.

512.wav
Ah, me too.

513.wav
I don't know. Some of the villagers just started to feed on each other.

514.wav
If you hadn't come along, I'm sure we would have met the same grim fate.

515.wav
Thank you.

516.wav
Unfortunately, we cannot regenerate our cores.

517.wav
Cores contain the data which forms our self-consciousness.

518.wav
If one is destroyed, there is no way to restore it.

519.wav
We usually store our cores in safe places.

520.wav
But this time, the villagers had their cores destroyed as well as their bodies.

521.wav
It was once occupied by a cadre of fellow machines that had gone berserk.

522.wav
However, 2B took care of that threat.

523.wav
It is quite safe now.

524.wav
We've been using it for storage for some time.

525.wav
A2! Stop that at once!

526.wav
If we're destroyed now, we can't be restored! This isn't funny!

527.wav
Ah, me too!

528.wav
You must let me help you!

529.wav
I'll smash them up and kill them!

530.wav
Why are they coming after us? Why?

531.wav
A2? I have an idea.

532.wav
Please buy me a bit of time.

533.wav
I'll kill you. I'll kill you!

534.wav
I must protect the children!

535.wav
Are you alright, A2?

536.wav
I fear for the children. Let us hurry to them!

537.wav
I must return to the children as soon as possible.

538.wav
Oh, hello there! Such a nice quiet place here, isn't it? No distractions at all.

539.wav
Pity about all the junk, however. I keep trying to clear it away, but it seems to be never ending.

540.wav
Pascal? Hmm, that sounds oddly familiar.

541.wav
Oh well.

542.wav
How? How could this happen?

543.wav
Would you like to take a look at my wares?

544.wav
Ugh, not that I'm sure what any of this actually does, or why it was left here in the first place.

545.wav
I taught them everything. All my thoughts and emotions.

546.wav
I've gathered up some of the junk from this place. What do you think?

547.wav
I thought it would serve them well in the future, but instead...

548.wav
I really must do something about all this trash.

549.wav
Fear.

550.wav
I taught the children what fear is.

551.wav
I thought they had to know so they wouldn't rush heatlessly into danger.

552.wav
But...instead!

553.wav
If I knew this could happen, I never would have!

554.wav
A2, you aren't leaving me like this, are you?

555.wav
A2, I need your aid.

556.wav
Please, you have to end this for me.

557.wav
I cannot live with this heartbreak inside me.

558.wav
I need you.

559.wav
I need you to delete my memories.

560.wav
And if not... Then I need you to kill me.

561.wav
Thank... ya...

562.wav
Thank you.

563.wav
Thank you, A2.

564.wav
Thanks for watching!

565.wav
How... how could you... A2?

566.wav
You?

567.wav
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought perhaps that I knew you.

568.wav
Goodness, where did everyone go?

569.wav
Well anyway, my name is Pascal. I'm the leader of this village.

570.wav
Of course I will. You have my word. And Uncle Pascal would never lie and break his word.

571.wav
And Uncle Pascal would never allow your break his rust.

572.wav
You promised to read and memorize that botanical field guide, remember? But now you'll play with us when we're dying, right? Yeah! Promise us!

573.wav
Um, hello there. Hello? Testing, testing!

574.wav
Uh, 9S? Yes, it is me. Many apologies for the sudden transmission.

575.wav
I heard that you were searching for the missing child, yes?

576.wav
Well, if you would, please consider this a personal request from myself as well. Go find the child as quickly as you can.

577.wav
She's such a good little girl and so fond of her sister.

578.wav
She's probably somewhere around the desert at the moment.

579.wav
That's where she's likely to find the dented plate her sister needs.

580.wav
Thank you so much, and please be careful, alright?

581.wav
Help! Help me!

582.wav
Thank you so much for saving me!

583.wav
Wait, please! I have no intention of harming you!

584.wav
My name is Pascal, and while it's true that I am a machine life form, I also detest fighting of any kind.

585.wav
Uh... I see.

586.wav
If that will save your soul, then so be it.

587.wav
You... aren't going to kill me?

588.wav
You.

589.wav
No. Never mind.

590.wav
You have my thanks.

591.wav
Ah, thank you so much!
