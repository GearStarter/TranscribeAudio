34.wav
Bye.

35.wav
Go!

36.wav
Ah, 2B.

37.wav
Ah, 2B.

38.wav
Maintenance finished.

39.wav
Maintenance finished.

40.wav
You detonated your black box in order to defeat the enemy.

41.wav
You detonated your black box in order to defeat the enemy.

42.wav
Bold, but risky. Try not to be so reckless next time.

43.wav
Bold, but risky. Try not to be so reckless next time.

44.wav
I know you're fresh out of maintenance, but I have another mission for you.

45.wav
I know you're fresh out of maintenance, but I have another mission for you.

46.wav
I need you to head to the surface, rendezvous with the resistance and do some recon.

47.wav
I need you to head to the surface, rendezvous with the resistance and do some recon.

48.wav
We haven't been able to get in touch with them.

49.wav
We haven't been able to get in touch with them.

50.wav
So we'll need you to look into that as well.

51.wav
So we'll need you to look into that as well.

52.wav
2B9S. We've lost contact with several URHEL units that were on their way to the surface.

53.wav
Their black boxes are online, so we presume they're still alive.

54.wav
We've tracked the location of their signals.

55.wav
So I need all your units on the surface to head over and investigate.

56.wav
Yorha, this is your commander.

57.wav
For the first time in centuries, we've intercepted a signal belonging to the aliens.

58.wav
These are the creatures that are in direct command of the machine life forms on this planet.

59.wav
If we can destroy them, we can end this long and arduous war once and for all.

60.wav
Our Intel team is hard at work attempting to analyze the source of the signal, but we're not there yet.

61.wav
We need more data.

62.wav
All YORHHA units are hereby ordered to prioritize data collection above all else.

63.wav
We can't let this chance slip through our fingers.

64.wav
Glory to mankind.

65.wav
Then they were dead this whole time.

66.wav
The Council of Humanity needs time to formulate a plan.

67.wav
Until then, this information must be kept confidential.

68.wav
Speak of it to no one.

69.wav
Your next mission is to gather additional intel on the individual known as Pascal.

70.wav
This order comes directly from the council.

71.wav
Knowledge of such unique individuals is essential for the success of future missions.

72.wav
Bunker to 2B and 9S.

73.wav
We've picked up a signal from the black box of a fugitive known as A2.

74.wav
What you see in front of you is your enemy.

75.wav
She deserted us. She's destroyed multiple Pursuit Androids.

76.wav
Now kill her before she kills you.

77.wav
I see.

78.wav
Well, at least you're both safe.

79.wav
That's an incredibly powerful unit you just faced.

80.wav
You should probably keep your distance in the future.

81.wav
Mm.

82.wav
I'm afraid that's classified.

83.wav
2B 9S, come in.

84.wav
Emergency orders incoming.

85.wav
The carrier ship that was set to resupply has come under attack.

86.wav
It's currently being engaged by a swarm of machines.

87.wav
I've asked all Yorha troops in the city ruins for assistance, and I'll need you to provide backup as well.

88.wav
I'm sending flight units and coordinates now.

89.wav
Good luck. Out.

90.wav
to be.

91.wav
Good job destroying that machine.

92.wav
Upon further analysis, we learned that the machine, code named Adam, was responsible for managing half of their entire network.

93.wav
A disruption of this magnitude to their network should weaken the machine significantly.

94.wav
He'll undergo a full data overhaul up here.

95.wav
Assuming we don't encounter any problems, we're planning to partner him with you again.

96.wav
In the meantime, I have another mission for you.

97.wav
I've mailed you the briefing. Go ahead and take a look.

98.wav
9S

99.wav
I'm sorry, you're needed back at command.

100.wav
[Silent]

101.wav
You left quite a trail when you accessed the main server.

102.wav
[Silent]

103.wav
[Silent]

104.wav
Yes.

105.wav
We installed the Council of Humanities server on the surface of the Moon.

106.wav
Mankind no longer exists.

107.wav
In truth, humans never went to the moon at all.

108.wav
Any transmissions received from the Moon are just dummy signals we set up in advance.

109.wav
The only thing there is a small bit of data relating to the human genome.

110.wav
Humans were already extinct when the aliens attacked.

111.wav
All the details are stored on this memory chip.

112.wav
If you want to look at it, I won't stop you.

113.wav
[Silent]

114.wav
No one fights without a reason.

115.wav
And we need a god worth dying for.

116.wav
To be 9S.

117.wav
What are you doing here?

118.wav
A virus? What are you talking about?

119.wav
None of our ground units reported anything about a virus.

120.wav
And why did you leave the battlefield anyway? I didn't order a retreat.

121.wav
んっ

122.wav
No.

123.wav
If anyone is acting infected here, it's you.

124.wav
How is that even possible?

125.wav
Damn it!

126.wav
But tell me, why weren't you two infected?

127.wav
I see.

128.wav
I too was synced up with the server.

129.wav
There's no time.

130.wav
You two are the last remaining members of Yorha.

131.wav
It's your duty to survive.

132.wav
Besides, this is my command.

133.wav
Let me at least fulfill my duty here to the end.

134.wav
[Silent]

135.wav
Normally you'd be called, but we'll be calling to be.

136.wav
Continue to observe the situation and dispatch them.

137.wav
Bunker to 2B.

138.wav
The signal from the access point just came back online. Good job.

139.wav
Go on.

140.wav
which means they know that Facility is one of our network terminals.

141.wav
Damn, they're getting smarter by the day.

142.wav
Thank you. I'll be sure to share this with the Council of Humanity on the Moon.

143.wav
All units, be on the lookout for a missing Yorha in the city ruins.

144.wav
This unit was in possession of several plug-in chips that contain classified information.

145.wav
I need you to seek out whatever intel you can regarding their current whereabouts and status.

146.wav
Hello, this is the Resource Recovery Unit, now activating Defense Mode.

147.wav
ああ

148.wav
You beat that thing with surface-based gear? That's a surprise.

149.wav
Thanks for the backup.

150.wav
You guys are amazing!

151.wav
Thanks, we owe you one.

152.wav
うぅ…

153.wav
Thank you.

154.wav
9S... that's that kid who was with you, right?

155.wav
I saw him all right. That explosion sent him flying.

156.wav
Hard to say. I'll take my best guess at a landing spot and transfer the data to you.
