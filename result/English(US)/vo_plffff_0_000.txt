[Possible Noise] MMMM

448.wav
11S to 9S, come in.

449.wav
Um, just about wrapped up here. How about you?

450.wav
Roger.

451.wav
Be sure to head back to the bunker when you're done so you can sync your data.

452.wav
Until your combat data is uploaded, none of the scanner models can run updates.

453.wav
Appreciate it.

454.wav
This is 1B. I'm facing heavy enemy resistance.

455.wav
Is anyone available to provide support?

456.wav
Much appreciated.

457.wav
You saved my life. Thank you.

458.wav
Uuhm...

459.wav
Uh, got it!

460.wav
Hold up! The captain is ordering a retreat!

461.wav
No... How could you?!

462.wav
9S...9S!

463.wav
9S!

464.wav
9S

465.wav
I see.

466.wav
What say we go stock up over there?

467.wav
Ugh.

468.wav
9S.

469.wav
Stop calling me ma'am.

470.wav
There's no need to be so formal.

471.wav
Is there something you forgot?

472.wav
Yes, Commander.

473.wav
Understood.

474.wav
Understood.

475.wav
Orders are orders.

476.wav
Roger.

477.wav
Understood.

478.wav
These machines are talking.

479.wav
ふーん

480.wav
What's with the weird looking outfits?

481.wav
んん

482.wav
うん

483.wav
Yeah.

484.wav
What's that?

485.wav
Stay focused.

486.wav
These are Android bodies.

487.wav
What is this?

488.wav
Who is this guy?

489.wav
What the hell just happened?

490.wav
Alright, let's go back.

491.wav
No, we should keep fighting.

492.wav
Hmm. I heard something about that back at the resistance camp.

493.wav
Right.

494.wav
Hmm.

495.wav
There's no point trying to work out unsolvable problems.

496.wav
What are those?

497.wav
What the?

498.wav
If these are machines, why aren't they attacking us?

499.wav
What's this?

500.wav
We need a way through.

501.wav
If they aren't hostile, fighting them is a waste of time.

502.wav
Yeah.

503.wav
What's this? Some kind of crystal?

504.wav
A plant cell.

505.wav
What the hell?

506.wav
Are we seriously being attacked with dead androids?

507.wav
Alright, this ends now.

508.wav
You got it.

509.wav
We have to save those androids.

510.wav
Thanks for the assist.

511.wav
Oh.

512.wav
What is it?

513.wav
The machines don't have feelings.

514.wav
You said that yourself.

515.wav
Hostiles.

516.wav
What's with the flag?

517.wav
What's that?

518.wav
Surrender, huh?

519.wav
はぁ

520.wav
So why don't the machines, or the aliens who created them, attack the bunker directly?

521.wav
They originally came here from outer space, right?

522.wav
They all have white flags.

523.wav
Let's follow it.

524.wav
Let's go back to Pascal again.

525.wav
9S, let's go back and get some data from the machines.

526.wav
Fair enough.

527.wav
We'll sort it out later. Let's go.

528.wav
on it.

529.wav
Damn it!

530.wav
Copy that.

531.wav
What is this?

532.wav
Guess we'll see once we get there.

533.wav
If we're lucky.

534.wav
What is this place?

535.wav
You.

536.wav
wiped out.

537.wav
Why them?

538.wav
Assist you with what?

539.wav
The aliens were already dead.

540.wav
Stop complaining.

541.wav
Care to fill me in?

542.wav
You again.

543.wav
So this has a transporter now, huh?

544.wav
That concludes our report on the events surrounding the alien wreckage.

545.wav
Of course.

546.wav
Understood.

547.wav
I'll rest if I feel like it.

548.wav
We don't get to choose our assignments.

549.wav
And you should work on keeping your opinions in check.

550.wav
Your ha aren't allowed to be emotional, remember?

551.wav
I'm heading to the transporter.

552.wav
We need to talk.

553.wav
Pascal

554.wav
Aside from this village, are there any other machines that are cut off from the network?

555.wav
Forest Kingdom?

556.wav
Where is it?

557.wav
No getting through here.

558.wav
More meaningless conjecture.

559.wav
You're getting distracted.

560.wav
Good idea.

561.wav
I'm aware of how to fight.

562.wav
You just be careful.

563.wav
These machines.

564.wav
What is with these guys?

565.wav
Let's go 9S.

566.wav
んっ

567.wav
She's gone.

568.wav
Yeah.

569.wav
Alright.

570.wav
9S, why did you ask Pascal about A2?

571.wav
It's not recommended to interface with machines without consulting command.

572.wav
Though I suppose such intense curiosity can be admirable in its own way.

573.wav
Still, machines are the enemy. Don't forget it.

574.wav
Let's stay sharp and head back to the resistance camp.

575.wav
We should run a check on our consciousness data and resupply.

576.wav
Seriously?

577.wav
Is that what we need to protect?

578.wav
Androids don't need to bathe.

579.wav
As long as you perform regular cleaning and maintenance, bathing is unnecessary.

580.wav
If she didn't order others around, what kind of leader would she be?

581.wav
Enemy aerial unit destroyed.

582.wav
Reverting back to Area Reconna.

583.wav
Didn't I kill that already?

584.wav
Is that... a machine?

585.wav
Oh, is that all?

586.wav
Go ahead.

587.wav
So basically, if this thing reaches land, we're screwed.

588.wav
Got it.

589.wav
Ugh, this thing's armor is too thick. We need more firepower!

590.wav
Direct? Oh right!

591.wav
Huh.

592.wav
What?

593.wav
No!

594.wav
He has a plan. Just hold on!

595.wav
on it.

596.wav
To be to Bunker. Come in. Over.

597.wav
Running system diagnostics. Core functionality appears intact.

598.wav
Never mind that. I need a status report.

599.wav
8 hours?

600.wav
Where's 9S?

601.wav
If you found something, that means he must be alive.

602.wav
Put in a request to the commander for immediate approval to begin a search.

603.wav
Will do. To be out.

604.wav
Pod, I need you to scan for any nearby black box signals.

605.wav
Never heard of it.

606.wav
Let's go.

607.wav
I'm looking for something called a dynamic scanner that can detect black box signals.

608.wav
Yes.

609.wav
I need a scanner that can detect faint black box signals.

610.wav
No, not really.

611.wav
I've picked up a response on the scanner.

612.wav
Huh, this might be useful.

613.wav
Got it.

614.wav
It's funny.

615.wav
You're oddly chatty today.

616.wav
Proposal denied.

617.wav
Pond, employ a check module and a logic virus vaccine.

618.wav
Easy. I've contacted the bunker. They should be here soon.

619.wav
Please, anything will help.

620.wav
Thank you. You should stay here until the rescue team arrives.

621.wav
9S should have landed around here.

622.wav
Wrong route. Better go back and see if there's another one.

623.wav
Would 9S have made it this far inside?

624.wav
Don't care.

625.wav
Why are there dead androids here?

626.wav
What is this?

627.wav
I know. Let's move.

628.wav
Who built it?

629.wav
What's with the corpses?

630.wav
You know nothing about humanity.

631.wav
Bastard.

632.wav
I know!

633.wav
I don't have time for you.

634.wav
I need to find 9S!

635.wav
んっ

636.wav
Shut up!

637.wav
You shut up too!

638.wav
Thanks.

639.wav
What?

640.wav
ん…

641.wav
Got it.

642.wav
This is 2B. Patch me through to the commander.

643.wav
What's going to happen to 9S?

644.wav
Thank you.

645.wav
Understood.

646.wav
Analyze current trends among the machines. Huh.

647.wav
Something tells me this is going to involve a lot of killing.

648.wav
Hmm. I suppose he might know something.

649.wav
Pascal, can you hear me?

650.wav
I need to know if you've seen any new trends or behaviors among the machines.

651.wav
No kidding.

652.wav
If that's what they want, why don't they move in?

653.wav
You don't say.

654.wav
please.

655.wav
Sounds good.

656.wav
Even you.

657.wav
It certainly does.

658.wav
So why are you still here?

659.wav
Appreciate it.

660.wav
Damn it!

661.wav
Less talk, more running.

662.wav
To be to Bunker.

663.wav
The connection's too unstable to use the transporter.

664.wav
We've had a run-in with hostile machines in the abandoned factory!

665.wav
We need an immediate escape route!

666.wav
Loop a distress signal.

667.wav
Damn it!

668.wav
We're locked in!

669.wav
んっ

670.wav
9S!?

671.wav
appreciated

672.wav
Oh, now what?

673.wav
9S

674.wav
That Goliath we just encountered.

675.wav
Do it!

676.wav
Will do.

677.wav
Alright.

678.wav
Thanks.

679.wav
No thanks.

680.wav
I'm heading back to the resistance camp.

681.wav
What about you?

682.wav
I see.

683.wav
Say again? I'm not receiving.

684.wav
Let's move.

685.wav
Why are their numbers increasing like this?

686.wav
Try contacting the bunker via laser relay system.

687.wav
The machine life forms are getting more violent.

688.wav
Let's get to the resistance camp, now!

689.wav
You okay?

690.wav
There are still enemies here, we can't just leave!

691.wav
Got it. You get the other androids out of here.

692.wav
What's going on here?

693.wav
は?

694.wav
You again?

695.wav
This is never going to end.

696.wav
I'm fine.

697.wav
Let's take this bastard down!

698.wav
We need to get back.

699.wav
Let's get to the village.

700.wav
SHIT

701.wav
Let's take these guys out first.

702.wav
What happened here?

703.wav
If we destroy this presiding unit, will it stop the rest?

704.wav
Pod, I need you to locate Eve's current position.

705.wav
We'll take care of Eve.

706.wav
What is this?

707.wav
on it.

708.wav
He's absorbing the life force of whatever's left on the network.

709.wav
on it.

710.wav
9S!

711.wav
Protecting Unit 9S while he hacks the system.

712.wav
Shut up!

713.wav
If 9S says he can do it, then he will!

714.wav
[Silent]

715.wav
9S, take him down!

716.wav
No!

717.wav
But you'll lose you, the you that exists at this very moment.

718.wav
9S

719.wav
Will do.

720.wav
I will. And thanks.

721.wav
The enemy just keeps coming.

722.wav
What's our status?

723.wav
Better take him out fast.

724.wav
Sounds good.

725.wav
This is Gorilla Unit 2B.

726.wav
We're on our way.

727.wav
Keep your guard up. Optimism is what gets people killed.

728.wav
All we can do is fight.

729.wav
This is Unit 2B.

730.wav
Sounds good.

731.wav
We're heading over now to provide support.

732.wav
Alright.

733.wav
Damn it, we took too long. They're gone.

734.wav
This is Gorilla Unit 2B.

735.wav
We're headed your way now.

736.wav
We're on it.

737.wav
This is Gorilla Unit 2B.

738.wav
We're heading in your direction now.

739.wav
We need to hurry.

740.wav
This is Unit 2B.

741.wav
We're in position to provide support for Attack Squadron Omega.

742.wav
If this keeps up, we can win.

743.wav
9S, scan the area to see if any reinforcements are on the way.

744.wav
What was that?

745.wav
Let my guard down. EMP hit me point blank.

746.wav
I gotta reboot!

747.wav
うっ…うっ…

748.wav
9S, kill my identification circuit. I can't attack them like this.

749.wav
No.

750.wav
Wait, what?

751.wav
Attack functions aren't working!

752.wav
Do it!

753.wav
Pod, report our status to command.

754.wav
God dammit!

755.wav
Got it.

756.wav
Pod, send an emergency distress signal to command.

757.wav
Pod!

758.wav
Damn it! They're still jamming us?!

759.wav
Shit, what happened to the bunker?

760.wav
I can't keep doing this forever!

761.wav
Sounds good.

762.wav
Are you done yet?

763.wav
We have to report back to command.

764.wav
Commander.

765.wav
We're telling you, Yorha has gone berserk!

766.wav
That's not the operator. It's-

767.wav
They're still conscious.

768.wav
∂∂

769.wav
Commander, the bunker is lost!

770.wav
We have to evacuate!

771.wav
I don't know!

772.wav
Commander, we need to get some flight units from the hangar and get out of here!

773.wav
Commander!

774.wav
But 9S can hack into your systems and-

775.wav
[Silent]

776.wav
Commander...

777.wav
Hostiles?

778.wav
It's Yorha!

779.wav
Uh. Uh.

780.wav
Alright, enough of this shit.

781.wav
9S, I need to take over your controls!

782.wav
I'm getting us out of here!

783.wav
Stealth function released!

784.wav
Gotta find a way to land this thing.

785.wav
God dammit!

786.wav
Remove the contamination and reset!

787.wav
んっ

788.wav
Bunker's gone. There's no point in backing up anyway.

789.wav
Ugh...Ugh...Ugh...

790.wav
9S

791.wav
My body is...

792.wav
[Silent]

793.wav
I can't eliminate the virus.

794.wav
I have to keep it from spreading to other androids.

795.wav
Pod, give me a location that's low on Android signals.

796.wav
You don't say...

797.wav
Almost... there!

798.wav
A... Two...

799.wav
It's just a statue.

800.wav
It moved.

801.wav
What was that?

802.wav
What?

803.wav
That's certainly one way to put it.

804.wav
Maybe you should ask him.

805.wav
Who knows?

806.wav
Maybe you should ask him.

807.wav
We can't seem to locate the required material.

808.wav
ふん?

809.wav
So destroy it.

810.wav
I remember seeing large two-legged machines in the desert.

811.wav
Finding this stuff is proving tougher than I'd hoped.

812.wav
Let's look around.

813.wav
You know, I'm still not sure any of this is a good idea.

814.wav
Did you learn anything from the factory data?

815.wav
We know we can find pristine screws on big bipedal machines, but what about large gears?

816.wav
There's still a lot about machines that we don't understand.

817.wav
Gather as much data as you can, no matter how irrelevant it may seem.

818.wav
Right, let's go take out some small fry.

819.wav
We still don't have what we need.

820.wav
Surely just a little damage won't hurt.

821.wav
We're no different.

822.wav
We've destroyed machines beyond counting.

823.wav
Perhaps someone sees that as a sin.

824.wav
No idea.

825.wav
Your scientific curiosity is getting out of hand, 9S.

826.wav
Over there.

827.wav
We should leave before more enemies arrive.

828.wav
You got me.

829.wav
I'm on it.

830.wav
We must have lost him somewhere.

831.wav
Oh, that's unfortunate.

832.wav
Nice shack.

833.wav
So we're vets now? That's new.

834.wav
I assume you have at least some idea where to start looking for animal medication?

835.wav
We have no right to judge.

836.wav
We're soldiers that were created to kill.

837.wav
Is that?

838.wav
I've been thinking about the machine who was leading that pack.

839.wav
It seemed less like imitation and more like actual animal behavior.

840.wav
Perhaps.

841.wav
Yeah.

842.wav
I suppose.

843.wav
Indeed.

844.wav
Maybe.

845.wav
Got it.

846.wav
Right, let's get her back to Pascal's village.

847.wav
9S, where's the girl?

848.wav
Don't know, don't care.

849.wav
Huh? You're the chatty one, work it out.

850.wav
Huh.

851.wav
Yep.

852.wav
The resistance is a valuable ally to Yorha.

853.wav
By helping them, we also help ourselves.

854.wav
So no, I don't think they're a pain.

855.wav
Look, a corpse.

856.wav
Let's bring this back to her friend.

857.wav
She wants intel on A2, does she? Where should we start?

858.wav
Look.

859.wav
Pod, help me out here.

860.wav
What's the data?

861.wav
Why do a bunch of machines have A2's data?

862.wav
Pod, analyze and collate the information from those chips.

863.wav
No kidding.

864.wav
Some things just aren't easy to talk about.

865.wav
especially for a soldier who's been fighting that long.

866.wav
9S, you.

867.wav
You might understand yourself someday.

868.wav
Well, aren't we generous?

869.wav
All this help for no personal gain? I know she's pretty, but...

870.wav
Whatever.

871.wav
Gifts are such a useless ritual.

872.wav
It's rude to give a person something without their permission. What if they don't want it?

873.wav
Feelings are prohibited.

874.wav
One affirmation will suffice.

875.wav
Stay alert. She could be our killer.

876.wav
Let's ask that guy over there.

877.wav
Let's go talk to her.

878.wav
んっ

879.wav
Some things are better left unknown.

880.wav
9S.

881.wav
Pod, analyze this machine.

882.wav
Call it professional curiosity.

883.wav
Are you saying this thing wanted revenge?

884.wav
I guess the weaker one lost.

885.wav
It's the truth she has to know.

886.wav
[Silent]

887.wav
Understood.

888.wav
To beat operator 6-0. Material handover complete.

889.wav
How do you know all this?

890.wav
to be here.

891.wav
Understood.

892.wav
Yeah?

893.wav
I have some information about that, Commander.

894.wav
The access point went offline because machine lifeforms were jamming it.

895.wav
Understood.

896.wav
I read you, Operator. Go ahead.

897.wav
We'll do.

898.wav
Understood.

899.wav
Is that all of them?

900.wav
Let's check this thing out.

901.wav
I don't see any damage.

902.wav
This is YORHA Unit 2B. Connect me to Bunker Operator 6-0.

903.wav
The transporter was being jammed by machine life forms. It should be working now.

904.wav
Roger.

905.wav
I see.

906.wav
part.

907.wav
I didn't say anything yet.

908.wav
That's right.

909.wav
You think?

910.wav
Alright.

911.wav
Pod, take a photograph of the Desert Rose and send it to operator 6-0.

912.wav
To be here, go ahead.

913.wav
Some, yes. I've seen lilies, cherry blossoms, daffodils, and even lunar tears.

914.wav
I'll try to send more if I can.

915.wav
Machines attacking indiscriminately.

916.wav
Agreed.

917.wav
Watch out, they're still alive!

918.wav
What's it saying?

919.wav
What was with that thing?

920.wav
They'll find out in the end.

921.wav
And so will we.

922.wav
A lunar tear.

923.wav
Are you remembering something?

924.wav
んっ

925.wav
Where are we?

926.wav
Emil, what is this place?

927.wav
Interesting.

928.wav
ふん?

929.wav
Thank you.

930.wav
Everyone has memories that are precious for one reason or another.

931.wav
It's not for us to judge their value.

932.wav
They're important to her. That's all we need to know.

933.wav
Huh, that's new.

934.wav
Engaging. Pod, analyze the enemy.

935.wav
Haven't I fought this thing before?

936.wav
Understood.

937.wav
Engaging enemy.

938.wav
Brother? So there's another one?

939.wav
There's another one of those strange machines.

940.wav
Roger.

941.wav
A machine seeking revenge for its family?

942.wav
How absurd.

943.wav
That's a Yorha unit.

944.wav
So this is where you landed.

945.wav
Pod, can you access her black box?

946.wav
Hmm

947.wav
She was planning to go AWOL.

948.wav
I'll bring this weapon back to 16D in the bunker.

949.wav
Hmm. Don't need this.

950.wav
So it's junk, basically.

951.wav
Makes sense.

952.wav
A library must be that long narrow room.

953.wav
What's this?

954.wav
Some kind of writing.

955.wav
Is this the treasure?

956.wav
Pod, scan this bio code and run a positional search.

957.wav
Got it.

958.wav
Don't ask me.

959.wav
That should be enough deer and boar meat. Let's get it back to the trader.

960.wav
Mm.

961.wav
There from your, huh?

962.wav
You're both currently wanted by command for desertion. Disengage and surrender immediately.

963.wav
んっ!

964.wav
[Silent]

965.wav
Let's find out.

966.wav
Let's go.

967.wav
We're here to fight. That's all.

968.wav
Relics from the old world, eh?

969.wav
Enemies?

970.wav
these enemies.

971.wav
Explain.

972.wav
Warfare was entertainment?

973.wav
Understood.

974.wav
Oh.

975.wav
A Yorha only chip?

976.wav
Roger.

977.wav
Ships with classified data, is it?

978.wav
You mean stamp it?

979.wav
Easy for you to say.

980.wav
Deluxe, huh?

981.wav
What do you mean?

982.wav
Emile sure is acting odd.

983.wav
Pod.

984.wav
Nice work.

985.wav
Are these a meal?

986.wav
Emil!

987.wav
What?

988.wav
What?

989.wav
Damn it!

990.wav
Sound advice.

991.wav
No!

992.wav
Enough!

993.wav
[Possible Noise] Ugh!

994.wav
Emil.

995.wav
You'll be alright. We can repair you.

996.wav
Emil.

997.wav
Is this a pod?

998.wav
Why was it abandoned?

999.wav
Pod, reactivate it for me. If it's usable, try to overwrite the original owner with my ID.

1000.wav
I caught a pod?

1001.wav
Pod, reset it and try to overwrite the original owner ID.

1002.wav
Yes?

1003.wav
Oh.

1004.wav
of

1005.wav
I'm good.

1006.wav
What?

1007.wav
9S works just fine.

1008.wav
Roger that, Nine. Zuh.

1009.wav
Roger that 9S.

1010.wav
Cut the chatter and engage the enemy.

1011.wav
No complaining about your work.

1012.wav
Exchanging information with the resistance is a vital part of our mission.

1013.wav
Besides, being a gopher is safer than being locked in combat all the time.

1014.wav
Not dying beats dying any day.

1015.wav
A general idea is good enough.

1016.wav
This is 2B, nothing to report.

1017.wav
It's fine. Does that question have anything to do with our operation?

1018.wav
Feeling nice has no bearing on completing missions.

1019.wav
To be here. What's wrong?

1020.wav
I am definitely not the person to discuss this with.

1021.wav
You leaving would be bad for me. It would affect mission efficiency.

1022.wav
All Model B combat units require the assistance of an operator.

1023.wav
So.

1024.wav
That's all. Closing this channel.

1025.wav
This is 2B, nothing to report.

1026.wav
Flowers?

1027.wav
Don't eat it.

1028.wav
I don't need to hear about-

1029.wav
ふぅ…

1030.wav
This is Yorha Unit 2B.

1031.wav
If anyone is listening to this, there's something I need you to do.

1032.wav
If you ever meet up with Yura Unit 9S.

1033.wav
I want him... I mean...

1034.wav
I'm sorry. Please just give him the following message.

1035.wav
9S... the time I was able to spend with you...

1036.wav
It was like memories of pure light.

1037.wav
Thank you... Nines...

1038.wav
to be here.

1039.wav
Understood.

1040.wav
We don't need such things.

1041.wav
A t-shirt?

1042.wav
ふーん

1043.wav
When that day comes, I'm all for it.

1044.wav
Yep.

1045.wav
This is 3B, captain of Theta Squadron.

1046.wav
The enemy machines are multiplying in front of us! We can't hold this position!

1047.wav
Thanks.

1048.wav
We'll join you, if that's alright.

1049.wav
Heh. Having trouble over there?

1050.wav
Hunter Squadron deploying out of North 12C Defense HQ.

1051.wav
I'm the commanding officer, 4B.

1052.wav
Don't worry, we'll take it from here.

1053.wav
This is 4B, Captain of Vanguard Squadron Alpha.

1054.wav
We're being worn down by a fierce enemy attack.

1055.wav
Roger, and thanks.

1056.wav
Thanks for the assist.

1057.wav
We'll join you and provide further backup.

1058.wav
This is 5B. I can't hold out if this keeps up!

1059.wav
AHHHH Sid ia

1060.wav
Shit! This wasn't supposed to happen!

1061.wav
They've come for us, idiot! Prepare to engage and inform the captain!

1062.wav
Damn it! I'll kill you!

1063.wav
Shut your trap!

1064.wav
Understood!

1065.wav
2 2 B! Oh, damn it! Damn you to hell!

1066.wav
This is Unit 6B!

1067.wav
Sorry to say, but I'm in a bit of a mess. Any support would be appreciated.

1068.wav
I never expected we'd have this much trouble.

1069.wav
Let me help you out now.

1070.wav
This is Unit 7B with Vanguard Squadron Delta.

1071.wav
We're currently pinned down by a number of machines that appear to have lost their minds.

1072.wav
Roger, 2B. Much appreciated.

1073.wav
Thanks for the assist.

1074.wav
Understood. We'll join you there and lend a hand.

1075.wav
This is Unit 8B with Attack Squadron Omega. We've gained control of our assigned zone.

1076.wav
Heading out now to provide support elsewhere.

1077.wav
Are we ever glad to see you?

1078.wav
They came out of nowhere. We were fighting for our damn lives!

1079.wav
22B... 64B... What the hell?

1080.wav
You... you did this!

1081.wav
Shut up! You don't know anything!

1082.wav
This is 9B of Epsilon Squadron.

1083.wav
requesting immediate reinforcements.

1084.wav
Got it. Thank you.

1085.wav
You're a lifesaver.

1086.wav
9S here, go ahead.

1087.wav
Roger that.

1088.wav
Yeah, yeah.

1089.wav
Fine.

1090.wav
Man, this is a real pain.

1091.wav
Fine.

1092.wav
Ooh, must have been rough out there.

1093.wav
Firing missile.

1094.wav
To be. What's going on?

1095.wav
We have to help her. Let's go!

1096.wav
Where am I?

1097.wav
and engaging.

1098.wav
Continuing support.

1099.wav
Upload Toopy's memory data package.

1100.wav
It's fine. Upload 2B's data first.

1101.wav
It's fine. Upload 2B's data first.

1102.wav
Looks like it's time to help 2B get herself set up.

1103.wav
She's probably waiting in her room now.

1104.wav
Sorry to barge in on you- Oh. Looks like you've already started.

1105.wav
The hangar's up ahead. Let's go.

1106.wav
The commander's put me in charge of your maintenance, ma'am.

1107.wav
By the way, have you checked your mail at the terminal yet? I doubt there are any important messages, but just in case.

1108.wav
That means I'll be performing regular checks on you from now on.

1109.wav
Are you carrying enough supplies on you? If not, you can always use the terminal in your room to replenish them.

1110.wav
Come to think of it, do we have enough supplies?

1111.wav
Oh, don't worry. We 9S models are the best around, you know.

1112.wav
Though I suppose we're not exactly known for our modesty.

1113.wav
Did you forget something?

1114.wav
This here's my room. Feel free to swing by whenever you want.

1115.wav
Hm? What is it, ma'am?

1116.wav
Huh?

1117.wav
Uh, alright, if you say so.

1118.wav
Oh, I almost forgot.

1119.wav
Not that there's much to do here.

1120.wav
The commander was calling for you.

1121.wav
We better go see what's up, man- Er, 2B.

1122.wav
Doesn't Yorha have a dedicated resistance contact already?

1123.wav
The surface? That means we'll be getting flight units, huh?

1124.wav
Better head for the hangar.

1125.wav
Heh, usually we can't get near flight units. They're way too expensive for us grunts.

1126.wav
Too bad they can't mass produce these things yet.

1127.wav
Hey 2B, why do you think they sent a combat model like you to a recon job?

1128.wav
Hey 2B, why do you think they sent a combat model like you to a recon job?

1129.wav
If all they want is Intel, we scanner models are built for that kind of thing.

1130.wav
Alright, alright.

1131.wav
According to our intel, none of the machines in this area are hostile.

1132.wav
We've been seeing more and more enemies like this lately.

1133.wav
They just stand there and stare into space. It's pretty weird.

1134.wav
Hey, Toopy!

1135.wav
You should know better than to try that. Not even a cutting-edge yorha like you would survive that kind of fall.

1136.wav
Try not to act so recklessly, alright?

1137.wav
This must have been quite a city once upon a time. Too bad Vegetation's claimed most of it now.

1138.wav
So this is the resistance camp, huh?

1139.wav
We should probably go talk to their leader first thing.

1140.wav
Hmm? You know about 2B?

1141.wav
She seems a bit... rough.

1142.wav
Gah! That caught me off guard.

1143.wav
Guess we better be careful even when it seems like there's no one around.

1144.wav
Nice, operator! You work fast!

1145.wav
Yeah, yeah.

1146.wav
Looks like it. So, Jack Ass, was it? What are you doing all the way out here?

1147.wav
Who opens a sealed gate with explosives?

1148.wav
There's gotta be an easier way, right?

1149.wav
Ugh, this sand sure is slippery.

1150.wav
Careful, we've got enemies approaching.

1151.wav
Yeah, I heard from the Resistance that they've been seeing this a lot lately.

1152.wav
Couldn't tell you why though.

1153.wav
Scary? Who? Us?

1154.wav
Do you think they even understand the concept of being scared?

1155.wav
I've seen that sort of thing when I was going through some old data. It looks like what humans used to wear long ago.

1156.wav
Certain human collectives used to use face paint like that too.

1157.wav
To be, it's fine. Their speech doesn't mean anything.

1158.wav
They're just emitting words at random.

1159.wav
If they wanted help, why would they be attacking us?

1160.wav
It's heading for that rocky area.

1161.wav
Once, long ago, a volcano erupted.

1162.wav
From the fires of the eruption, a god emerged.

1163.wav
One day, the god appeared before the machines and said,

1164.wav
Consciousness. Pain. Joy. Misery.

1165.wav
Fury. Shame. Desolation. The future.

1166.wav
The meaning of life.

1167.wav
I wonder why they insisted on living in such large groups.

1168.wav
Things must have been really dangerous around here, huh?

1169.wav
Man, humans sure are weird creatures.

1170.wav
Target confirmed. Let's get him.

1171.wav
Multiple machines detected ahead.

1172.wav
But what's with these Android bodies?

1173.wav
I wonder what makes them choose these words.

1174.wav
What are they doing here?

1175.wav
It's like they were gathered here.

1176.wav
There it goes!

1177.wav
Don't listen to them, 2B.

1178.wav
They don't have any feelings.

1179.wav
They're just imitating human speech.

1180.wav
Let's take them out.

1181.wav
I think he's evolving.

1182.wav
We better finish this quick!

1183.wav
Come on, through that hole!

1184.wav
I know! I've never seen a machine like that before.

1185.wav
We better report this to command.

1186.wav
Tooby, let's get out of here!

1187.wav
It stopped. Looks like we're safe now.

1188.wav
Let's move to an area with better reception so we can contact Command.

1189.wav
Okay, this is good. We should be able to reach command here.

1190.wav
The surface is blocked off. Let's head in from underground.

1191.wav
9S to bunker, do you copy?

1192.wav
Operator, we... uh... we just encountered a pair of humanoid machines.

1193.wav
We weren't able to capture them.

1194.wav
But I have combat data ready for upload.

1195.wav
Hopefully you can get something out of it.

1196.wav
Whew. I think we've earned a breather.

1197.wav
Say 2B? I was hoping we could talk about our next move.

1198.wav
I'm worried about the damage we took in that last battle with the machines.

1199.wav
Maybe we should return to the resistance camp to resupply and conduct maintenance?

1200.wav
You got it.

1201.wav
Roger that. Just try not to overdo it, okay?

1202.wav
Roger.

1203.wav
This is 9S, go ahead.

1204.wav
Target location confirmed.

1205.wav
I'm worried about the other androids.

1206.wav
We should probably check this out as soon as possible.

1207.wav
So 2B.

1208.wav
Those machines out in the desert look just like androids, right?

1209.wav
But we androids were modeled after our human creators.

1210.wav
So why would machines try to look like us?

1211.wav
I suppose.

1212.wav
Looks like our surface route's been cut off.

1213.wav
Maybe we can get through from underground.

1214.wav
They were found by the machines.

1215.wav
The machines called them... Treasures.

1216.wav
Each treasure had a different shape.

1217.wav
Each treasure.

1218.wav
If you need to rest, Tooby, we can go back to the resistance camp.

1219.wav
Well, this is weird.

1220.wav
Where does this corridor lead?

1221.wav
Maybe there's another route that will take us deeper inside.

1222.wav
There's gotta be some way to proceed further in.

1223.wav
This gate isn't going to open.

1224.wav
Pretty sure this is the last place we haven't searched.

1225.wav
I'm picking up a resistance presence in the amusement park.

1226.wav
Maybe there's another way around.

1227.wav
We're getting resistance signals from that building over there.

1228.wav
Let's see if we can't find another route.

1229.wav
Humans sure are strange creatures.

1230.wav
Let's look around for a route we can take.

1231.wav
These guys were ready for a fight from the start.

1232.wav
Guess they're attacking us after all.

1233.wav
These machines are heavily armed.

1234.wav
We'll regret it later if we let them escape. So let's take them out.

1235.wav
Do you really think it's a good idea to leave that tank behind?

1236.wav
We can rest easy now, huh?

1237.wav
Android Corpses.

1238.wav
Our records don't say anything about a machine like this!

1239.wav
It's trying to hack us!

1240.wav
If we take hacking damage, it'll affect our bodies as well!

1241.wav
Wait, I don't think-

1242.wav
Toopy, I'm detecting black box signals!

1243.wav
They aren't dead. They've been turned into weapons!

1244.wav
I've almost analyzed the enemy's hacking pattern.

1245.wav
I'm going to try to hack it back.

1246.wav
Keep it busy!

1247.wav
I'm working on it.

1248.wav
Oh, you mean the hacking? No worries.

1249.wav
Scanners are pretty good at that kind of thing.

1250.wav
I've got your back anytime.

1251.wav
I'm sorry, 2B. Their circuits are fried.

1252.wav
I think they were only being kept alive by that enemy.

1253.wav
So, um...

1254.wav
That machine had some pretty weird things to say, huh?

1255.wav
It's almost like it had actual emotion.

1256.wav
Yeah, I... I guess.

1257.wav
はっ

1258.wav
This thing is awfully verbose for a machine.

1259.wav
It could be a trap.

1260.wav
Still, we should at least head over there and gather data, right?

1261.wav
It does seem awfully suspicious.

1262.wav
But I've never seen a machine that could communicate at this level.

1263.wav
and might be worth checking out.

1264.wav
Hey, I read about that in a book once.

1265.wav
Oh, right. You wouldn't have seen that before.

1266.wav
Humans would use white flags to signal surrender.

1267.wav
They're sending supplies up from Earth to the Moon in the bunker.

1268.wav
There are no spare parts or fuel in space after all.

1269.wav
Well, there are a few theories about that.

1270.wav
But no one knows for sure.

1271.wav
Hard to tell what an alien is thinking, you know?

1272.wav
I know you're not thrilled about this, Tooby, but why don't we hear what these machines have to say? I'm curious what their intentions are.

1273.wav
Dang, I lost the machine.

1274.wav
Let's go back to the theater. They might be waiting for us there.

1275.wav
Looks like it's headed this way.

1276.wav
They don't appear to be hostile.

1277.wav
Looks like they really don't want to fight.

1278.wav
There's something weird about this village.

1279.wav
We should go back and look around some more.

1280.wav
2B! We can't trust anything the machines say!

1281.wav
He just started transmitting to us directly!

1282.wav
Your mouth can say anything it wants.

1283.wav
But you still don't have a heart.

1284.wav
What's that noise?

1285.wav
A Goliath?

1286.wav
This was a trap! I knew it!

1287.wav
We can get into the city ruins if we move that box.

1288.wav
Two of them?

1289.wav
That's your R&D for you.

1290.wav
Thanks, Operator.

1291.wav
2B, Command is deploying new flight units for us.

1292.wav
They just sent the coordinates, so let's get going.

1293.wav
We probably shouldn't get near that guy's feet.

1294.wav
Yeah, no. Let's find another route.

1295.wav
The flight units should be on the roof of that building up ahead.

1296.wav
It'll be dangerous, but we're not going anywhere unless we pass through that Goliath's legs.

1297.wav
We should be careful.

1298.wav
GAH!

1299.wav
2B!

1300.wav
Displaying data on central wiring hub.

1301.wav
Let's get to those flight units while we can.

1302.wav
Got it, thanks.

1303.wav
That's a weird looking enemy.

1304.wav
Why is there such a huge cavern beneath the city?

1305.wav
2B, we picked up the signal under the caved-in area. Let's go check it out.

1306.wav
Well, we finally figured out where that signal is coming from.

1307.wav
I used command's data to determine the signal's source and marked it on the map.

1308.wav
But it seems to be underground. Like, way underground.

1309.wav
Let's go back to where we picked up that signal.

1310.wav
You're not much for plans, are you, 2B?

1311.wav
The ground is caved in.

1312.wav
There must have been a hollow down there this whole time.

1313.wav
This hallway looks pretty old.

1314.wav
Look at all these dead machines.

1315.wav
Seems like they've been here for a long time.

1316.wav
I don't know. There's nothing like it in the database.

1317.wav
Some kind of... alien facility, maybe?

1318.wav
To be! Look out!

1319.wav
You destroyed your own creators?

1320.wav
Are you insane? We'd never do that!

1321.wav
Can you believe this, 2B? This guy's bonkers!

1322.wav
I killed my father.

1323.wav
I killed my mother.

1324.wav
I killed my father.

1325.wav
I killed my mother.

1326.wav
And in his hand he coldly gripped.

1327.wav
both the joy of growing up.

1328.wav
and the agony of being alone.

1329.wav
Yeah... We better get back to the bunker.

1330.wav
Back this way again? What a pain.

1331.wav
Yeah, yeah

1332.wav
About time we had access to those.

1333.wav
Transporters? They let you transfer your consciousness to a temporary body back in the bunker.

1334.wav
I heard some tech guys talking about it a while ago, but I didn't know they'd finally got it working.

1335.wav
Anyway, I'll mark the positional data on the map.

1336.wav
Um, thank you?

1337.wav
Interesting design they went with there.

1338.wav
Still, transporters are pretty handy.

1339.wav
They're way faster than flight units when it comes to traveling between Earth and the bunker.

1340.wav
Flight units also leave us open to attack, and they're expensive to operate too.

1341.wav
You mean that freaky machine we ran into?

1342.wav
Man, the commander sure is a slave driver, huh?

1343.wav
And now we have to go back to the city ruins.

1344.wav
Why don't we rest a little bit, Tooby? It's been a while.

1345.wav
Man, this job can be pretty rough sometimes, huh?

1346.wav
I think some of us are better at that than others.

1347.wav
Speaking of emotion, those Adam and Eve units sure seemed less than logical.

1348.wav
Fine.

1349.wav
Um...

1350.wav
Let's hear them out. Maybe we'll learn more about the machine life forms.

1351.wav
Gah! Damn it!

1352.wav
Don't just go breaking into our comms like that, Pascal.

1353.wav
Um, well... kinda.

1354.wav
You mean that singing thing?

1355.wav
This... Forest Kingdom sounds like something we should check out.

1356.wav
This must be the commercial structure Pascal was talking about.

1357.wav
The records say it was once a facility known as a shopping center.

1358.wav
Maybe there's some kind of mechanism we could engage?

1359.wav
If we were human, we probably would have gone shopping and such here, right?

1360.wav
You're so serious 2B, you know that?

1361.wav
ぐわっ!

1362.wav
Who the heck is the Forest King?

1363.wav
Well, what do you expect? I'm a scanner.

1364.wav
Combat was never meant to be my forte.

1365.wav
Check this guy.

1366.wav
He's just running away.

1367.wav
Um, what's that?

1368.wav
This thing's weird, Tooby. Let's kill it!

1369.wav
Okay, what was that?

1370.wav
Looks like the forest is just ahead.

1371.wav
Here they come.

1372.wav
Better keep your guard up.

1373.wav
I will, Tooby.

1374.wav
They were talking about a king, right?

1375.wav
I saw what looked to be a castle further in. Maybe we should take a look.

1376.wav
So those machines had a king?

1377.wav
But how can a concept like loyalty be understood by a machine?

1378.wav
How are we supposed to reach that castle?

1379.wav
I can't believe these guys are so well spoken.

1380.wav
Looks like the freak show's in town.

1381.wav
Don't listen to what they're saying to be.

1382.wav
Yep, this looks like a king's castle alright.

1383.wav
To be. That's an android.

1384.wav
A Yorha-type Android.

1385.wav
Annihilation? But why?

1386.wav
TO BE!

1387.wav
But she's...

1388.wav
Operator, this is 9S. Patch me through to the commander.

1389.wav
Let's go after her, 2B.

1390.wav
Let's go after her, 2B.

1391.wav
We need to follow A2 now.

1392.wav
I'm sorry, Commander. We failed to defeat the fugitive.

1393.wav
Damn! She got away.

1394.wav
That must be the gate Pascal opened for us.

1395.wav
Commander, why did A2 desert the force?

1396.wav
Oh? Huh.

1397.wav
to be.

1398.wav
Let's go ask Pascal about A2.

1399.wav
He might know something.

1400.wav
Um, Pascal? This is 9S.

1401.wav
Yeah, we're fine. But there's something we want to ask you about.

1402.wav
Actually, it needs to be in person.

1403.wav
whether in wind or rain.

1404.wav
Thunder or Snow.

1405.wav
or even amidst the rising flames of war.

1406.wav
They were always together.

1407.wav
They never understood why.

1408.wav
and yet they spent their lives nestled together.

1409.wav
forever.

1410.wav
forever and ever.

1411.wav
It'll be faster if you just take a look at this recording.

1412.wav
I see. All right, thanks.

1413.wav
Huh?

1414.wav
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

1415.wav
フッ

1416.wav
Thanks, 2B.

1417.wav
There sure are a lot of hostile enemies here.

1418.wav
Why are some machines so aggressive, while others couldn't care less about us?

1419.wav
The bedrock here was bombed out in the last war.

1420.wav
Those are the missiles we're looking for.

1421.wav
Looks like the whole city is starting to sink as a result.

1422.wav
Let's take him out already so I can be home in time for dinner and a bath.

1423.wav
Yeah, but come on 2B. It still feels good.

1424.wav
I think that's the last of the machines.

1425.wav
Commander?

1426.wav
You see? Total slave driver.

1427.wav
Hmm... if you say so.

1428.wav
I'm picking up a large-scale enemy inbound.

1429.wav
Looks to be 2.8 clicks southwest of us.

1430.wav
Wait!

1431.wav
I'm still picking up a large enemy presence!

1432.wav
What on... If it's that big, we should be able to see it!

1433.wav
It's freaking huge!

1434.wav
Crap! It's blocking close-range attacks with EMP blasts!

1435.wav
We've got to find another way to damage it.

1436.wav
EMP generator?

1437.wav
Oh come on! It's got an electromagnetic barrier over its whole body?!

1438.wav
Are you Yorha?

1439.wav
To be.

1440.wav
Let's leave this area to the reinforcements.

1441.wav
I have an idea.

1442.wav
You and I should meet up at the spot I just marked.

1443.wav
We've got mortars lining the shoreline here.

1444.wav
All the EMP shielding in the world won't help against close-range mortar fire.

1445.wav
I'll help aim.

1446.wav
2B, let's try for a more direct approach.

1447.wav
That's right. Lay down some fire in its stupid mouth.

1448.wav
We gotta bail, Toopy! This is bad!

1449.wav
A to B

1450.wav
I think I have another idea.

1451.wav
You keep that thing right where it is, okay?

1452.wav
Please, Toopy, this is gonna work!

1453.wav
2B!

1454.wav
I'm going to see if we can use those missiles back on the shore.

1455.wav
But I need you to destroy the EMP unit on that thing's back.

1456.wav
Otherwise they're just going to go off course.

1457.wav
Activate missile controls.

1458.wav
Prepare to launch!

1459.wav
Fire!

1460.wav
I didn't think this would be so hard to control.

1461.wav
Well aware, thank you!

1462.wav
The child held sway over enormous strength.

1463.wav
But sadly, he was also a little bit broken.

1464.wav
He spent his long days hurting those around him.

1465.wav
He tried his best to be good and kind.

1466.wav
But despite his efforts, things never seemed to turn out.

1467.wav
They told him he was unwanted.

1468.wav
They abandoned him in the deep, dark ocean.

1469.wav
And from the cold at the bottom of the sea, he cried out.

1470.wav
Mother.

1471.wav
Mother.

1472.wav
Mother.

1473.wav
Mother.

1474.wav
But his voice never reached his mother.

1475.wav
Each of the machines treated their treasures with great care.

1476.wav
One treasured family above all else.

1477.wav
Another treasured its older sibling.

1478.wav
Another treasured its own beauty.

1479.wav
But one more machine treasured something unique above all else.

1480.wav
Hate.

1481.wav
Yeah, yeah.

1482.wav
Fine.

1483.wav
Good.

1484.wav
You got it.

1485.wav
It took long enough.

1486.wav
Don't you think it's overkill to perform a full data overhaul?

1487.wav
Alright, alright, cram it.

1488.wav
Anyway, I just gotta sync up with the bunker server and then I'm outta here, right?

1489.wav
Huh? What was that?

1490.wav
Halt the data sync.

1491.wav
Yeah, I know that, but we just got some kind of weird noise.

1492.wav
Halt the data sync for 2B as well.

1493.wav
Let's figure out where that noise came from. Just to be sure, you know?

1494.wav
Open a port to the server.

1495.wav
Hmm, no time to examine everything. Better stick to the main data nodes.

1496.wav
What's a barrier doing here?

1497.wav
Hmm. Looks like records for supplies shipped to the moon.

1498.wav
Strange... there were a ton of empty containers.

1499.wav
That's weird. Why would they do that?

1500.wav
What's the point of all this heavy security?

1501.wav
All the black box data has been deleted, but it looks like everything else is here.

1502.wav
Huh? A new port just opened.

1503.wav
Man, this stuff is all wrong.

1504.wav
I need to check this out too.

1505.wav
An attack barrier? Really?

1506.wav
Why the heck would they install one of those in this server?

1507.wav
Let's see... Looks like info about how the Council of Humanity was formed as part of Project Yorha.

1508.wav
Wait... isn't that backwards?

1509.wav
After a long period of battles and adventures, the prophets spoke.

1510.wav
Oh, grant me the mercy of the land.

1511.wav
Oh, grant me the joy of the heavens.

1512.wav
Release me from my yoke of iron.

1513.wav
Thus shall our souls be.

1514.wav
wing

1515.wav
Uh... what was that?

1516.wav
Crap! Did they find me?

1517.wav
Close the server connection and activate my body.

1518.wav
Don't do anything too reckless, Tooby. We'll meet up later on.

1519.wav
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, 2B!

1520.wav
It's me, 9S!

1521.wav
I hacked into this machine from the bunker. I'm controlling it.

1522.wav
I'm gonna break into these factory systems and get you outta here!

1523.wav
I got it! I've been keeping an eye on you. I'm gonna shut off power to the factory now.

1524.wav
hacking progress at 50%.

1525.wav
Hacking progress at 80%!

1526.wav
Hacking complete!

1527.wav
2B, I just shut down the electrical grid.

1528.wav
Factory system at 20% control. You have to hold out for me, 2B.

1529.wav
Factory system at 50% control. Now we just have to do something about this core.

1530.wav
Factory system at 80% control. Hang in there, 2B.

1531.wav
90% 92 95 98

1532.wav
Operator? What happened?

1533.wav
Alright, I'll try to gain access from the main terminal.

1534.wav
Okay, good. 2B's black box signal is still up and running.

1535.wav
These comms are all messed up.

1536.wav
Guess I'll have to break into the other side and take control.

1537.wav
Nice.

1538.wav
Now I just have to unlock the door where 2B is.

1539.wav
I'd better secure an escape route.

1540.wav
If I want to reach 2B, I'll need to reach the factory's lower level first.

1541.wav
There we go. First door unlocked.

1542.wav
Uh oh, I'd better get to 2B fast.

1543.wav
2B, keep going straight!

1544.wav
Damn it! Maybe I should have taken over something with a little more power.

1545.wav
Door 2 disabled.

1546.wav
The door's open. Keep moving.

1547.wav
Look at all these broken machines.

1548.wav
A few still look usable. Better send these coordinates to the bunker, just in case.

1549.wav
It's open.

1550.wav
Exit route secured.

1551.wav
Alright, if I can hack this elevator and get it running, I can get 2B and everyone else out of here.

1552.wav
ガァッ

1553.wav
Oh

1554.wav
Those were the words I heard in the moon server.

1555.wav
But why?

1556.wav
Hmm? Ah, right.

1557.wav
Okay, good.

1558.wav
Commander

1559.wav
Understood.

1560.wav
That's what I wanted to speak with you about, Commander.

1561.wav
I found records stating that the Council of Humanity was established as part of Project Yorha.

1562.wav
But I'd always heard it was the other way around.

1563.wav
So did Yorha actually create the Council of Humanity?

1564.wav
But that means...

1565.wav
おはっ

1566.wav
But why would you?

1567.wav
Wait, you're just giving me this? But why?

1568.wav
The human race is... gone.

1569.wav
[Silent]

1570.wav
How do I tell 2B?

1571.wav
Combat stations? I better get a move on.

1572.wav
Any details?

1573.wav
What? How? They're supposed to be weakened!

1574.wav
Tooby! You okay?

1575.wav
We better hurry.

1576.wav
WHERE'S 2B?!

1577.wav
Toopy, you okay?

1578.wav
Right.

1579.wav
What do we do? There's too many!

1580.wav
Where are you going, Tooby? We need to hurry.

1581.wav
That's not the fastest way there.

1582.wav
We might make it if we go now.

1583.wav
Pascal? Come in, Pascal!

1584.wav
Damn it! They're here too!

1585.wav
It's Eve. It's gotta be.

1586.wav
You just worry about keeping the village safe, okay?

1587.wav
Looks like he's bombarding the area with forced connections.

1588.wav
I think all these transmissions are making the machines go haywire.

1589.wav
We have to find Eve and destroy him.

1590.wav
Now what?

1591.wav
What is it?

1592.wav
Damn it! We'll never get anywhere like this!

1593.wav
I'm going to try hacking into Eve and shutting him down.

1594.wav
Back me up, 2B!

1595.wav
Shit! Stupid barriers!

1596.wav
What is this?

1597.wav
Can't. Not when I'm this far in.

1598.wav
Just... a little more.

1599.wav
if I can remove Eve's object control function.

1600.wav
ガァッ

1601.wav
To be, now!

1602.wav
to be... taken down.

1603.wav
GAH!

1604.wav
I must have been corrupted when Eve detached from the network.

1605.wav
It's okay. I can always reload my backup data from the bunker.

1606.wav
Guess so.

1607.wav
But we can't upload this corrupted data to the bunker. So...

1608.wav
Hey, 2B. I was waiting for you.

1609.wav
I needed to give you this.

1610.wav
Say, 2B?

1611.wav
Ugh.

1612.wav
No, never mind. Just be careful.

1613.wav
before I could convince myself to tell to be the truth.

1614.wav
Our final major operation had begun.

1615.wav
Still, at the time, I knew nothing.

1616.wav
Not how the battle would end.

1617.wav
nor what fate stood in wait for us.

1618.wav
Um...

1619.wav
Roger.

1620.wav
The scanners are going to hack into the enemy's anti-air system and shut it down in advance of an all-out assault, right?

1621.wav
No killing the target. Got it.

1622.wav
Why are you talking to me like I'm a child?

1623.wav
Is it me, or does it seem like they're getting smarter?

1624.wav
Roger.

1625.wav
Got it.

1626.wav
Whoops.

1627.wav
You're totally treating me like a kid.

1628.wav
Fine...

1629.wav
Um, okay?

1630.wav
Almost there.

1631.wav
Boom? Is she serious?

1632.wav
A little multi-level hacking, huh?

1633.wav
I always do.

1634.wav
Yeah, yeah, no falling behind. Got it.

1635.wav
A surprise?

1636.wav
What is it?

1637.wav
And how will I provide support to the squad if I don't fight?

1638.wav
Aw, are you worried about me?

1639.wav
Wow, that's... harsh.

1640.wav
9S here, go ahead.

1641.wav
Um, just one left, I think.

1642.wav
Oh, right. I forgot about that.

1643.wav
Okay, I'll take care of it as soon as I'm done here.

1644.wav
Whew. That looks like everything.

1645.wav
Here we go.

1646.wav
Sounds like a plan.

1647.wav
Let me just mark the point on the map, and there.

1648.wav
To be.

1649.wav
Hey.

1650.wav
This is a machine I've hacked into before.

1651.wav
The operation is underway, and a few squads have already engaged the enemy.

1652.wav
I'll set off the delayed virus to see if I can damage it physically.

1653.wav
Our orders are to function as a kind of guerrilla unit that provides support as necessary.

1654.wav
I forwarded our squad's current positions to your map. You should head over there ASAP.

1655.wav
Our enemies are stragglers from the unnetworked machine life forms we fought previously.

1656.wav
Since they don't have a leader anymore, I'm thinking it should be a pretty easy job.

1657.wav
Fine.

1658.wav
Man, I can't see a thing.

1659.wav
Why are they going nuts like this? I thought Eve's network was destroyed.

1660.wav
We're heading out to support other squadrons.

1661.wav
We're heading out to support the next squad.

1662.wav
We should head to another area and provide support.

1663.wav
This battle really turned sideways on us, huh?

1664.wav
Man, this is tougher than I thought it would be.

1665.wav
Let's go help the next squadron.

1666.wav
You got it.

1667.wav
Much appreciated.

1668.wav
2B, let's move.

1669.wav
The... enemy's still here to be.

1670.wav
Are you okay?

1671.wav
Damn it! There's no end to them!

1672.wav
I gotta finish him off and help 2B!

1673.wav
I'll provide backup.

1674.wav
They... they have visual camouflage?

1675.wav
What the hell's going on here?

1676.wav
I have to protect 2B!

1677.wav
This viral attack... The EMP must have triggered it!

1678.wav
I gotta do something!

1679.wav
You okay?

1680.wav
I have to save 2P!

1681.wav
I'll remove the virus right now. Hold on.

1682.wav
They've been infected and taken over!

1683.wav
Got it.

1684.wav
That's because of their YORHA IDs!

1685.wav
2B, I need to hack into you and fry your identification circuit!

1686.wav
To be.

1687.wav
I located the unit that's jamming our comps.

1688.wav
The jamming is coming from that thing!

1689.wav
That should take care of the jamming.

1690.wav
Tobee, I have an idea!

1691.wav
It's possible to access the bunker through a backdoor in the system.

1692.wav
I can use that to initiate an emergency upload of our personal log data.

1693.wav
Then we set our black boxes to self-destruct and take them all out at once.

1694.wav
Data upload 30% complete.

1695.wav
50% complete!

1696.wav
We just hit 70%!

1697.wav
Almost. We're at 92%!

1698.wav
Tooby, your black box!

1699.wav
To be.

1700.wav
Wow.

1701.wav
The Yorha units on the ground were infected by a virus.

1702.wav
We had to detonate our black boxes in order to stop them.

1703.wav
That's because all communication with the bunker has been severed!

1704.wav
Are you nuts?

1705.wav
Damn! The doors!

1706.wav
Did the virus infiltrate the bunker itself?

1707.wav
Operator what?

1708.wav
To be! It's open!

1709.wav
Come on!

1710.wav
Stay focused, Tooby!

1711.wav
The transport terminal is corrupted. We need to get to the hangar and get some flight units.

1712.wav
It's probably because I deferred our data sync.

1713.wav
I noticed some weird noise in the bunker server data, so I paused the upload.

1714.wav
But Commander...

1715.wav
[Silent]

1716.wav
No... Oh no...

1717.wav
This signal, it's-

1718.wav
GAH!

1719.wav
You need to what?

1720.wav
Um, uh, okay.

1721.wav
Uh... w-wait! What are you-

1722.wav
NO!

1723.wav
Wait... 2B!

1724.wav
To be!

1725.wav
Where the hell is 2B?

1726.wav
Put it on the map!

1727.wav
I'm not going anywhere!

1728.wav
I'm in... the resistance camp?

1729.wav
Where's 2B?

1730.wav
Oh.

1731.wav
[Silent]

1732.wav
Thanks.

1733.wav
Apparently... What does that mean?

1734.wav
[Silent]

1735.wav
Let's check it out.

1736.wav
[Silent]

1737.wav
There's no reason for anything they do.

1738.wav
[Silent]

1739.wav
The heck was that?

1740.wav
Now they're just messing with us.

1741.wav
Two to go.

1742.wav
Seems like we'll need three authorization keys in total.

1743.wav
Hey, Pod.

1744.wav
Give me a rundown on what happened while I was resting.

1745.wav
I know.

1746.wav
Large structural units?

1747.wav
What do these units do?

1748.wav
Where's A2?

1749.wav
Alright.

1750.wav
Mark the positions of those units on my map, will ya?

1751.wav
I'm going to wipe out the machines.

1752.wav
I don't care about chain of command.

1753.wav
I have one goal now.

1754.wav
I'm going to kill every last machine.

1755.wav
And then...

1756.wav
I'm going to kill A2.

1757.wav
Is that one of our large units?

1758.wav
What's the resource it's transporting?

1759.wav
For what purpose?

1760.wav
Is this entire building made of machines? Even on the inside?

1761.wav
There's no meaning to anything they do.

1762.wav
I'll kill you. Heh.

1763.wav
That's my line.

1764.wav
Damn machines.

1765.wav
Is this writing?

1766.wav
I can't read it.

1767.wav
Okay then...

1768.wav
Machines can't feel pain.

1769.wav
Now shut up. Shut up. SHUT UP!

1770.wav
SHUT UP!

1771.wav
Machine parts.

1772.wav
Weapons, eh?

1773.wav
Pascal, that's...

1774.wav
uh you

1775.wav
Pod, search for the other structural units.

1776.wav
I need to find those authorization keys and destroy the tower.

1777.wav
It's fine. Run the search.

1778.wav
What is... that?

1779.wav
So... an elevator?

1780.wav
I'll have to try another one.

1781.wav
There's something written here too.

1782.wav
Pod, translate this.

1783.wav
No enemies?

1784.wav
What's this?

1785.wav
Oh, I get it.

1786.wav
I have to break the system protection before I can reach the core.

1787.wav
Huh. So that's how it works.

1788.wav
That huge structure is some kind of launch platform.

1789.wav
Yeah, and I hack into all of them, right?

1790.wav
A structure that size could probably shoot something into space pretty easily.

1791.wav
[Silent]

1792.wav
So this is some kind of cannon aimed at the human server on the moon?

1793.wav
Damn it.

1794.wav
The Yorra Black Box Circuitry.

1795.wav
It's made from cores from the machines?

1796.wav
That's... no!

1797.wav
That can't be true!

1798.wav
Huh? What's going on here?

1799.wav
My body.

1800.wav
Those are... my memories.

1801.wav
But why?

1802.wav
Stay the hell out!

1803.wav
my memories... to be...

1804.wav
OF MY GODDAMN MEMORIES!

1805.wav
These belong to me and me alone!

1806.wav
Shut up!

1807.wav
GET AWAY FROM THEM!

1808.wav
You're going down!

1809.wav
Pod, where's the next resource recovery unit?

1810.wav
Near field controls are down? Great.

1811.wav
I don't have that kind of time.

1812.wav
Shit

1813.wav
Uh.

1814.wav
I know.

1815.wav
Pod, mark the next resource recovery unit on the map.

1816.wav
over and over.

1817.wav
That language again.

1818.wav
God, huh?

1819.wav
What are these machines doing talking about gods?

1820.wav
Shut up!

1821.wav
Ugh... whatever.

1822.wav
Oh no...

1823.wav
So this operator model is...

1824.wav
No.

1825.wav
Operator!

1826.wav
Shit...

1827.wav
ウ� guns

1828.wav
It's alright... It's alright...

1829.wav
Because...

1830.wav
I'm going to kill you!

1831.wav
[Silent]

1832.wav
Am I?

1833.wav
operator.

1834.wav
Oh.

1835.wav
Situation report.

1836.wav
Good.

1837.wav
うっ…

1838.wav
OUTTA MY WAY!

1839.wav
Damn it! They won't stop coming!

1840.wav
Allies?

1841.wav
Tevila? Popola? I don't know.

1842.wav
What are you doing here?

1843.wav
What are you talking about?

1844.wav
None of this makes any sense!

1845.wav
んんっ

1846.wav
No, we can't just abandon them!

1847.wav
If we don't do something, they're gonna...

1848.wav
What's... this barrier?

1849.wav
I can't leave them alone. I've gotta go back!

1850.wav
Well, how do I break it down?

1851.wav
That's almost as bad as not going in at all!

1852.wav
I see.

1853.wav
I...

1854.wav
[Silent]

1855.wav
I hope you never have to understand.

1856.wav
I don't care.

1857.wav
I just have to kill them all.

1858.wav
Corrupted Yorha units!

1859.wav
I'm gonna kill you.

1860.wav
To be...

1861.wav
TO BE!

1862.wav
Don't worry.

1863.wav
I'm going to kill you now!

1864.wav
Still a few stragglers, huh?

1865.wav
んっ

1866.wav
On it.

1867.wav
You bastards!

1868.wav
SHUT UP!

1869.wav
Keep him coming.

1870.wav
I'll destroy them all.

1871.wav
All of them. And this tower!

1872.wav
What's going on?

1873.wav
So those red AIs are dead?

1874.wav
Goddamn machine.

1875.wav
Shut the hell up!

1876.wav
할

1877.wav
So what?

1878.wav
None of it matters.

1879.wav
Or didn't you know?

1880.wav
We aren't required in this world anymore.

1881.wav
Humanity is extinct.

1882.wav
That moon server you're so worried about was invented to give us androids something to fight for.

1883.wav
And Yorha was created to perpetuate the lie.

1884.wav
But in order to make sure no one ever learned the truth, we were designed to be killed.

1885.wav
They built a back door in the bunker and programmed it to activate after a certain amount of time.

1886.wav
The Commander. Me. To be.

1887.wav
Sacrificial lambs. All of us.

1888.wav
Isn't that hilarious? Doesn't it make you laugh?

1889.wav
Shut up!

1890.wav
You killed 2B.

1891.wav
That's all we need to kill each other.

1892.wav
[Silent]

1893.wav
It doesn't matter! NONE OF THIS MATTERS!

1894.wav
But if it doesn't matter, why do I long for humans like this?

1895.wav
Why do I desire the touch of something that no longer exists?!

1896.wav
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! SHUT UP!

1897.wav
Fine then... I'll just destroy it.

1898.wav
It all goes away. That'll solve everything!

1899.wav
I... We, Yorha... We don't deserve to be loved by this world.

1900.wav
Plant life has claimed most of the central area.

1901.wav
Big plants too.

1902.wav
Hmm. I wonder if there are any huge boars in such, too.

1903.wav
Huh.

1904.wav
It's not moving. Maybe just a statue?

1905.wav
No response.

1906.wav
ああっ

1907.wav
Die!

1908.wav
A to B. I've been thinking about something.

1909.wav
Do you think this Sartre fellow is being a little too... I don't know... glorified?

1910.wav
Do you think this s***er fellow is being a little too... I don't know... glorified?

1911.wav
This is exhausting.

1912.wav
Sartre doesn't care at all about anyone but himself.

1913.wav
And yet his followers just keep talking about how great he is.

1914.wav
What's the point of all this? And what's he even getting out of it?

1915.wav
Well, he's nothing if not consistent. A weirdo right to the very end.

1916.wav
I wonder if all his followers being female had something to do with his weirdness. Did the human sexes interact with each other like this?

1917.wav
doesn't care at all about anyone but himself.

1918.wav
Hang on, Tooby.

1919.wav
Maybe we should ask an operator.

1920.wav
This machine is still alive.

1921.wav
9S to operator. Quick question. Do you know where we might find a pristine screw?

1922.wav
Maybe we should hold off.

1923.wav
Thanks, Operator. 9S out.

1924.wav
Its main drive has been trashed, so there's no way it can attack us.

1925.wav
and we might be able to learn something interesting if we study it.

1926.wav
Let's go.

1927.wav
If they're used in large bipedal machines, we might find them in other large machines as well.

1928.wav
The more data we have, the better, right?

1929.wav
We can use this screw to repair that big machine.

1930.wav
Just how it was manufactured. Pretty boring, actually.

1931.wav
Let's try the operator again.

1932.wav
9S to operator, we're trying to track down a large gear. Any idea where to start the search?

1933.wav
Roger.

1934.wav
Okay, that should be everything we need to repair the machine.

1935.wav
Thanks, Operator. That's good to know.

1936.wav
Heh. Straight to the point as always, 2B.

1937.wav
Yeah, most of the gears were too damaged to use.

1938.wav
Come on now, 2B.

1939.wav
What a strange machine.

1940.wav
Wow, it just chose death.

1941.wav
Huh? How so?

1942.wav
to be.

1943.wav
What was all that about?

1944.wav
So this machine mother has a child, eh?

1945.wav
It's surprising to see them form familial units like that.

1946.wav
I wonder if they'll let us examine their brain circuits if we bring the kid home.

1947.wav
Joking, I'm joking. Mostly.

1948.wav
Careful, Tooby. I'm picking up hostiles.

1949.wav
Easy there, little guy. It's alright. You weren't scared, were you?

1950.wav
Come on, kid, don't be unreasonable.

1951.wav
Any ideas to be? I've never dealt with a snot-nosed machine before.

1952.wav
Uh oh, more enemies incoming!

1953.wav
Are you finished?

1954.wav
Your mother is worried about you. She sent us here to find you.
