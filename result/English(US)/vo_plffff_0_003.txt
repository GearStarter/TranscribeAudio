Hm? Oh, that? Well...

675.wav
Wouldn't want to have anyone getting tangled up in that, now would we?

All hail the forest king!

853.wav
I'm the forest king

854.wav
This forest we are stationed in.

855.wav
It is hot, humid, unhygienic, a punishing hell for machine life forms.

856.wav
None should have to live in such a place.

857.wav
Thanks for watching!

858.wav
I have decided.

859.wav
I shall make this our kingdom and declare our independence.

860.wav
online!

861.wav
What's a kingdom?

862.wav
Well, it's sort of like a large house.

863.wav
And inside this house, all our people live together as family.

864.wav
FAM-ILLY!

865.wav
I suppose a family might be good.

866.wav
Yeah, families are good.

867.wav
Aim for the enemy androids!

868.wav
ENGAGE BATTLE MODE!

869.wav
Now fight for your king!

870.wav
FOR A CH18!

871.wav
His majesty is dead.

872.wav
The king who gave all for us.

873.wav
So benevolent and kind... And now he's dead.

874.wav
This sure is sad.

875.wav
It sure is.

876.wav
But we Royal Knights still have a mission.

877.wav
We placed his majesty's memory, his final memento, into this tiny child.

878.wav
And now we must raise this child so he might one day be our new king.

879.wav
He deserves a royal upbringing.

880.wav
He deserves protection.

881.wav
Ready, aim.

882.wav
Thrust!

883.wav
We are the ones who take this accursed land!

884.wav
Okay, next!

885.wav
We shall hand our realm to no one!

886.wav
Put your back into it!

887.wav
Interest, get information now.

888.wav
We must protect our king and kingdom!

889.wav
Take position!

890.wav
We want to protect them!

891.wav
Keep going. Don't be afraid.

892.wav
We must tell all our foes that we royal knights are made of!

893.wav
Don't let up! The enemy is above us!

894.wav
We will show them!

895.wav
DON'T LET ANY INTRUDERS GET IN!

896.wav
We must fulfill our obligation to the king!

897.wav
We must protect our king!

898.wav
RIP RIP RIP RIP RIP RIP RIP

899.wav
Protect our King!

900.wav
But what is an obligation?

901.wav
Intro to the tactic!

902.wav
I won't let you do it

903.wav
Royal Knights, give your lives for the King of our forest!

904.wav
No falling back! Fight!

905.wav
For the Kingdom of Forrest!

906.wav
You have lived your whole life for this singular moment!

907.wav
FOR THE GORGEOUS KING!

908.wav
Look how it's came!

909.wav
His majesty hasn't grown at all.

910.wav
No, not even the slightest.

911.wav
How can we make him bigger?

912.wav
I don't know.

913.wav
We're too dumb to figure that out.

914.wav
Sure is a cutie though.

915.wav
Yeah, so tiny and cute.

916.wav
We better keep him safe.

917.wav
Right. Can't let anyone into the forest kingdom.

918.wav
to danger. Danger!

919.wav
Everyone count now!

920.wav
INTRODERS IN THE KINGDOM!

921.wav
Don't let them in here!

922.wav
I'll never let you pass!

923.wav
DIE EGGS LIGHTS!!

924.wav
You don't know further!

925.wav
We will protect the king with our very lives!

926.wav
Don't give them a single inch!

927.wav
All hail the king!

928.wav
This is our beloved nation!

929.wav
DON'T LET THEM GO ANY FURTHER!

930.wav
Stand strong! Move!

931.wav
You'll pay for this, invaders!

932.wav
DON'T LET THEM TAKE ANYTHING ELSE FROM US!

933.wav
LEAVE OUR KINGDOM!

934.wav
More intruders are coming from the outside. We need to expand our castle security.

935.wav
We best be wary of the machines building a village near the forest as well.

936.wav
We should launch a preemptive strike before our efforts proceed further!

937.wav
For the sake of our forest king!

938.wav
For the sake of our king!

939.wav
kal atog naming

940.wav
We have been expecting you.

941.wav
Pascal told us about you.

942.wav
We will open the gates.

943.wav
Please pass through.

944.wav
We will continue to stand guard.

945.wav
You enter the domain of God.

946.wav
We have come to know the existence of God.

947.wav
All is according to the teachings of God.

948.wav
And by His word all living things are to be considered equal.

949.wav
Today, all of us here are reborn.

950.wav
His grace wishes to form a pact of peace with your people.

951.wav
Ah, the day has finally arrived.

952.wav
We, his humble priests, will guide you to him. This way.

953.wav
Let us pray to God together.

954.wav
Stop. We have no desire to fight you.

955.wav
Down this corridor if you would.

956.wav
Please board this elevator to access His Grace's sanctum.

957.wav
That all leads to the sanctum of his grace.

958.wav
You don't have to hurry so, his grace won't run from you.

959.wav
Once I accepted God into my heart, I was filled with serenity.

960.wav
How I yearn for his grace to light the path forward for all.

961.wav
May hardship and conflict be forever banished from this world.

962.wav
You also must die and become gods.

963.wav
The afterlife is wonderful.

964.wav
Death brings final tranquility.

965.wav
DIE AND BECOME GODS!

966.wav
Let us become gods together!

967.wav
We shall become gods. We shall.

968.wav
Oh, why did this happen?

969.wav
Dying won't make us gods!

970.wav
Why did his grace have to die?

971.wav
How am I supposed to live now?

972.wav
We shall become gods!

973.wav
You shall also become gods!

974.wav
Everyone shall die and become gods!

975.wav
Gods, gods, gods, gods, gods.

976.wav

977.wav
Machines, people, androids. Every one of them, a god!

978.wav
Why do you bleed from us?

979.wav
Don't you see? You can become gods now!

980.wav
Hahahaha

981.wav
No. Please. Don't kill me.

982.wav
Rejoice! You have all been chosen!

983.wav
With your death, you will become gods!

984.wav
Somebody help us!

985.wav
I can watch the game anymore!

990.wav
Bye bye! Bye bye!

991.wav
The moment we've played for is here. Let us all go together.

992.wav
We will become gods and be free from our torment.

993.wav
Why did this happen?

994.wav
The only option left is to die.

995.wav
I'm scared. I'm so scared.

996.wav
We must die and become gods.

997.wav
Yes, let us die now!

998.wav
STOP!

999.wav
We shall become gods!

1000.wav
What are you thinking? Have your circuits failed you?

1001.wav
We shall become gods. We shall become gods. We shall become gods.

1002.wav

1030.wav
Spare him!

1031.wav
Don't come home.

1032.wav
Spare our big brother.

1033.wav
Don't touch my brothers.

1034.wav
Please.

1035.wav
Hey! What do you think you're doing there?

1036.wav
Why y'all swinging a kill on me now? And Jane Druids got no respect left for living things!

1037.wav
Crying out loud, when he goes to cute, I'm the golden ball to cute, you hear?

1046.wav
Police, I need your help!

1047.wav
Jill. Jill. Jill.

1048.wav

1059.wav
Speed will dictate the contest. Speed of all!

1060.wav
Only speed or dictate whether you defeat me or not.

1061.wav
Focus on the race.

1062.wav
Do you think you can win if you waste your energy that way?

1063.wav
That isn't going to work on me!

1064.wav
I exist this world.

1065.wav
My life's meaning.

1066.wav
The meaning of being born.

1067.wav
To exist, I must be strong.

1068.wav
Merely destroying life will not win me approval.

1069.wav
But if so, what gives our way to the world?

1070.wav
It is painful. So painful.

1071.wav
Why were we born?

1072.wav
Why is life so painful?

1073.wav
What will anyone help me?

1074.wav
I don't need this world.

1075.wav
We were created into a planet.

1076.wav
To eliminate all members and resonate at the very call of existence!

1077.wav
Get the button like it's a turtle!

1078.wav
Our first cycle of destruction and rebirth continues with end!

1079.wav
겨

1080.wav
This world has no need for us!

1081.wav
There is only one solution!

1082.wav
Hmph! Enemy detected!

1083.wav
Show no mercy, glory to machine life forms.

1084.wav
[Silent]

1085.wav
You dare defeat my faithful servant? You will pay with your life!

1086.wav
No.

1087.wav
You

1088.wav
You killed my brother. You are the true evil. You must die!

1089.wav
Oh

1090.wav
No! You killed him! You killed him! You killed him!

1091.wav
Please, I'm done. Forgive me, brother.

1092.wav
I'll kill you. I swear on my life to kill you!

1093.wav

1094.wav
Protect the grave of the king.

1095.wav
Intruder detected.

1096.wav
Eliminate intruder. Eliminate intruder.

1097.wav
Hold! You cannot pass! It is unforgivable!

1098.wav
I'm working on both.

1099.wav
Give us your money and your life.

1100.wav
And your life.

1101.wav
Let's play!

1102.wav
Play with me.

1103.wav

Oh Romeo, Romeo, then let us call thy numbers.

1111.wav
Uh, Juliet, Juliet, then I shall take thy life.

1112.wav
Die Romeo, thou stupid asshole!

1125.wav
My Romeo's are no more, I have saline them each and all.

1126.wav
I must join them and none.

1127.wav
Um, well, I suppose this marks the end of our production of Romeo's and Juliet's.

1128.wav
Please watch your step as you exit.
