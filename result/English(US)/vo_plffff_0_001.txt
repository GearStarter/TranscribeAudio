0.wav
So quit with the whining and let us take you home already.

1.wav
Huh? I don't see that little machine anywhere.

2.wav
He may have gone back to where we first found him. Let's look around.

3.wav
Yeah, this is rough. Better go tell mom what happened.

4.wav
Stay close, alright? Don't go wandering off.

5.wav
She sure was. So let's go home and have you apologize, alright?

6.wav
Okay, now wha- wait, what?

7.wav
We'll probably need to recreate old human recipes.

8.wav
We should be able to find something in the commercial facility ruins.

9.wav
So it's okay to kill some animals, but not others?

10.wav
Seems kind of arbitrary, no?

11.wav
Yeah.

12.wav
Wow. So the leader of the pack was a machine?

13.wav
That's the last of them.

14.wav
Let's go tell that machine that his animal friends are safe.

15.wav
Oh yeah?

16.wav
Yeah, I guess it was kind of odd. You thinking there's a reason for it?

17.wav
How can you love animals and yet not bat an eye at the death of a fellow machine?

18.wav
I do not get these guys.

19.wav
About goddamn time!

20.wav
If I ever see that bossy robo-monk again, it'll be too soon, let me tell ya.

21.wav
んっ

22.wav
Stupid machine. All he cared about was getting stronger until we finally scrapped him.

23.wav
But now we don't have to see him ever again. What a relief.

24.wav
She sure cares about her little sister, huh?

25.wav
Still, it's pretty funny to hear machines talk about siblings.

26.wav
Do you think she just means they were built at the same factory or something?

27.wav
Y-Pascal? Is that you?

28.wav
Is that?

29.wav
Is that?

30.wav
How'd you get lost out here anyway?

31.wav
Aw, come on now, don't cry.

32.wav
Did you at least find what you needed?

33.wav
I'm sure she will, but I bet she'll be even happier to see you back home safe and sound.

34.wav
Huh? Oh, hell.

35.wav
We must have gotten separated somehow.

36.wav
Let's go back to where we first found her. I bet she's waiting there.

37.wav
No one made the desert. It's just an area that lost all its vegetation due to a lack of precipitation.

38.wav
This caused lasting changes in the soil, which means plants aren't able to

39.wav
Soil? Uh, it's dirt. Ground. The stuff we're walking on?

40.wav
Wind is just a force caused by changes in temperature and atmospheric pressure and...

41.wav
Huh. That's actually a hard question now that I think about it.

42.wav
Kinda deep, really. I mean, where does the wind blow from? What do you think, 2B?

43.wav
Um...

44.wav
Well, machines can't really make children. Neither can androids, now that I think about it.

45.wav
Uh, 2B? Little help here?

46.wav
Oof.

47.wav
Wow, it's getting late! Let's get you home already.

48.wav
んん

49.wav
Well, that was exhausting.

50.wav
Okay, that's everything the supply trader asked for.

51.wav
Man, these chores are a real pain in the butt, huh?

52.wav
Yeah, yeah.

53.wav
Is this the music box she was looking for?

54.wav
Man, this thing is all rusted over.

55.wav
You think the box belonged to her?

56.wav
Poor girl died a long time ago by the looks of it.

57.wav
We could check out the energy reactions generated during battles.

58.wav
The fusion reactors of androids and machine life forms shut down when they're destroyed.

59.wav
and we can detect the energy release during that process.

60.wav
We're the only units doing any combat missions in this area, right?

61.wav
So if we detect any stray energy reactions, it probably means A2 is involved.

62.wav
Yeah, okay. We've got some readings around the abandoned factory. I'll put it on the map.

63.wav
That's A2's handiwork, I bet.

64.wav
But I'm not picking up any sign of A2 herself.

65.wav
Hm? What in the world?

66.wav
Hey 2B, I'm picking up other reactions. We should check them out.

67.wav
Okay, I think that's the last of the data chips.

68.wav
That operation was carried out by the Yorha generation that came before us, right?

69.wav
Anyway, mission complete, I suppose. Let's get back to the resistance camp.

70.wav
Wonder what that was all about. Something must have been up between anemone and A2.

71.wav
I guess so.

72.wav
はぁ

73.wav
Right.

74.wav
Hmm?

75.wav
Whoa, it's not like that!

76.wav
I mean, she is pretty, but that's... It's not...

77.wav
We need to find someone wearing a red hood.

78.wav
Sounds like that red hood was a gift of some sort.

79.wav
Wow, okay. Where'd that come from?

80.wav
Mmm, I think it's more about the feeling behind it than the actual item, right?

81.wav
Yeah, yeah.

82.wav
Oh, for the love of- Fine. Yeah.

83.wav
Our red-hooded target should be in the desert.

84.wav
But there's only one female resistance member at the desert station.

85.wav
Hmm. I don't see her.

86.wav
But if it's the same person, why would she have had the killer's hood?

87.wav
Examining storage circuits. 88%. 92%. 98%.

88.wav
Type E. I didn't know there was such a thing.

89.wav
Did you too, B?

90.wav
Yeah, I suppose so.

91.wav
So if we use those numbers from the resistance campus coordinates...

92.wav
Yeah, we're pretty much standing right on top of whatever they're pointing to.

93.wav
Huh? What for?

94.wav
Aw, come on now. That concept is far too complex for a machine.

95.wav
This corpse... I wonder if it's the resistance member we're looking for.

96.wav
Let's check his memory.

97.wav
Seems this one came here looking for revenge as well.

98.wav
[Silent]

99.wav
I really hate this.

100.wav
I'm going to feel terrible telling that woman what happened to her friend.

101.wav
no matter what that truth actually is.

102.wav
Gotcha.

103.wav
I see the Commander's as much of a slave driver as ever.

104.wav
It's like she was built to be as efficient and hard-assed as possible.

105.wav
Uh... are you serious?

106.wav
What the heck was all that about?

107.wav
We've got company. Looks like machines.

108.wav
That's not good.

109.wav
Yeah, but that's not all. While they knew it was connected to our network, they didn't try to destroy it.

110.wav
It's almost like they were trying to lay a trap.

111.wav
This whole place is like a giant machine's nest.

112.wav
I wonder what it used to be like.

113.wav
No kidding? What kind of weapons?

114.wav
Human-shaped weapons, huh? Wonder if they worked like flight units.

115.wav
I think I can access the data over there.

116.wav
There we go. That's what 210 wanted.

117.wav
Now I just have to send it to her.

118.wav
Got it.

119.wav
This should be good enough.

120.wav
Pod, upload that data to operator 210.

121.wav
This is 9S.

122.wav
What, like a diary?

123.wav
Sounds like it.

124.wav
Wait, I can get rewarded for doing this?

125.wav
No, but...

126.wav
Hey, don't disconnect me!

127.wav
I'm here.

128.wav
Hey, wait just a-

129.wav
She didn't even give me a chance to turn her down this time.

130.wav
Why did all these people live together way back then, huh?

131.wav
They ran out of space? How strange.

132.wav
How is that possible when there's so much of it out there?

133.wav
Okay, this should be enough. What do we have?

134.wav
Broken toys, dirty ledgers, small shoes.

135.wav
Pod, take a photo of this junk and send it to operator 210.

136.wav
Hello, operator. How can I help you?

137.wav
Great. Does it seem useful?

138.wav
Oh, alright.

139.wav
Uh, familial?

140.wav
Operator? Are you there?

141.wav
And she disconnected me.

142.wav
Man, she disconnected me again.

143.wav
Well, if she's thanking me, I guess it must have gone okay. Right?

144.wav
Look at all the corpses. Is this some kind of graveyard?

145.wav
I'm on it.

146.wav
There's more.

147.wav
Don't listen to it, Tooby!

148.wav
It was talking.

149.wav
Maybe that machine who sent us here knows something about this.

150.wav
We should try asking her.

151.wav
Souls in heaven, huh?

152.wav
Do either of those things exist?

153.wav
Okay, that's grim.

154.wav
I'm not sure I even know what it means to be smart anymore.

155.wav
Heh, don't I know it.

156.wav
Hmm, that's a strange flower.

157.wav
Huh? When did you get here?

158.wav
Sounds rough.

159.wav
This is a lunar tier, right?

160.wav
We'd better let Emil know.

161.wav
We found a lunar tier. It's located at

162.wav
Uh, okay. I hope he doesn't expect me to just stand here all day.

163.wav
やっ

164.wav
You mean humans?

165.wav
It's a lunar tear. I'd better tell Emil.

166.wav
I found one of those flowers you were looking for. It's over at

167.wav
Don't move? I'm actually kinda biz-

168.wav
Damn, you're fast!

169.wav
You did?

170.wav
It's a lunar tear. I'd better tell Emil.

171.wav
I found a lunar-

172.wav
As speedy as always, I see.

173.wav
What happened here, Emil?

174.wav
Say a meal?

175.wav
How old are you anyway?

176.wav
I should probably tell Emil about this lunar tip.

177.wav
I didn't even contact you yet.

178.wav
Emil? Are you okay?

179.wav
Hmm?

180.wav
Oh?

181.wav
What's it for?

182.wav
This must be what Emil's key is for.

183.wav
Wow! Look at all the lunar tears!

184.wav
Uh, sorry. I don't get it.

185.wav
Uh, sorry. I don't get it.

186.wav
Where's the original Emil now?

187.wav
Oh.

188.wav
Hmm... these places look familiar.

189.wav
One looks like the amusement park, one looks like the desert, and one looks like the forest.

190.wav
Let's keep our eyes open next time we're in any of those areas.

191.wav
Hold on. This is one of the places in that Resistance member's photographs.

192.wav
Better record the coordinates.

193.wav
This place looks familiar.

194.wav
Oh right, it's from that woman's photograph.

195.wav
I'll be sure to get her the coordinates.

196.wav
Okay, that's all the coordinates that Resistance member wanted.

197.wav
I'll be honest though, I don't quite get why she cares about these particular photos.

198.wav
Yeah, I guess.

199.wav
That machine... I think something's wrong with it.

200.wav
はっ!

201.wav
I can't believe that thing decided to end itself.

202.wav
This is where that machine fell.

203.wav
Have we seen these things before?

204.wav
Whoa, they're speaking!

205.wav
Hey, I've fought this machine before, right?

206.wav
If you say so.

207.wav
Ready to engage.

208.wav
Brother? Wait, there's more of these things?

209.wav
There's another of those machines. I suppose it's going to attack me, right?

210.wav
Got it.

211.wav
Machines wanting to avenge their families? That's absurd.

212.wav
And yet... I...

213.wav
Doesn't look like I'll need this.

214.wav
So it's just a bunch of junk?

215.wav
A key, huh?

216.wav
A library, huh?

217.wav
What's this?

218.wav
Some kind of writing.

219.wav
Wait, so is this the treasure?

220.wav
Pure white, huh? I wonder if it's some kind of albino.

221.wav
Not that I have any idea how to capture the thing.

222.wav
Yeah, I guess that might work.

223.wav
Man, this thing is fast. I'll need to use food to make friends with it if I want to complete this mission.

224.wav
Is that a serious thing you just said?

225.wav
Right then, let's hop on this thing and take it back to the resistance camp.

226.wav
Pod, scan this bio code and run a positional search.

227.wav
Got it.

228.wav
It's data from the old world, but it's...

229.wav
Oh geez, I wonder if we should really hand this over to Pascal.

230.wav
I mean, the commander might want it, right?

231.wav
Maybe it's more of a feeling thing. Like, some people just want to eat it every now and then?

232.wav
Who knows? Maybe it's more of a feeling thing. Like some people just want to eat it every now and then.

233.wav
Hey, you got me.

234.wav
Whatever.

235.wav
That should do it for the deer and boar meat. Guess we should report back to the traitor.

236.wav
That should do it for the meat. Let's get it to that traitor.

237.wav
Yorha members deserting and attacking the Resistance no less?

238.wav
Detained? Easy for you to say.

239.wav
They got away.

240.wav
Please, you have to stop fighting!

241.wav
Destroy? What happened to detain?

242.wav
We...killed them...our fellow units.

243.wav
Why the hell did they steal from the Resistance in the first place?

244.wav
You think Anemone might know something to be?

245.wav
So it turns out those soldiers didn't actually steal anything. Which means... What?

246.wav
[Silent]

247.wav
9S to command, come in.

248.wav
It's about the Yorha soldiers who deserted.

249.wav
No, but I mean... the Resistance says that none of their supplies are actually missing.

250.wav
So what's going on here?

251.wav
はぁ?

252.wav
What? Operator, I don't understand.

253.wav
Huh? Operator? Operator?

254.wav
What the hell is that all about?

255.wav
But...

256.wav
Okay, that's everything the twins asked for.

257.wav
Those desert roses the twins wanted should be around here somewhere.

258.wav
Finding one in a place like this won't be easy.

259.wav
Why are those two engaged in such dangerous work anyway?

260.wav
That's the last desert rose. Better get these back to Devola and Popola.

261.wav
Those two sure draw some difficult assignments, huh?

262.wav
Hmm. Maybe I should talk this over with anemone.

263.wav
Oh shoot, I forgot to ask Devola where to find that tree sap she wanted.

264.wav
Pod, search for regions where I might be able to obtain tree sap.

265.wav
The ones Devola mentioned maybe?

266.wav
What's with the crazy shape?

267.wav
Now I just need to collect some tree sap.

268.wav
Hopefully this is enough sap.

269.wav
relics from the old world.

270.wav
Uh oh.

271.wav
What the heck were those guys?

272.wav
Human culture?

273.wav
Warfare as entertainment? What were humans thinking?

274.wav
Got it.

275.wav
How so?

276.wav
A Yorha only chip, huh?

277.wav
Understood.

278.wav
Chips with classified data, huh?

279.wav
So those packages for transport are in here somewhere?

280.wav
I can't get them out like this.

281.wav
Ugh, better make a path first.

282.wav
Okay, that should be all of the packages.

283.wav
This place is even messier than before.

284.wav
That should be everything.

285.wav
This must be the resistance storage facility.

286.wav
You're taking this pretty seriously.

287.wav
Why the heck is there a stamp inside a machine?

288.wav
Deluxe? We'll see.

289.wav
I was afraid we'd find this.

290.wav
The only personal items are these dog tags.

291.wav
Let's go take a look. Maybe some of them will still be alive.

292.wav
Man, there's blood everywhere. Whatever happened must have happened right here.

293.wav
Talk about a bad way to go.

294.wav
When was it sent?

295.wav
That means they're still alive. Let's go!

296.wav
Over there, initiating rescue!

297.wav
Damn!

298.wav
I suppose we'd better return their belongings.

299.wav
We should bring everything back to that resistance member.

300.wav
A tradition of mourning the dead.

301.wav
to be.

302.wav
To be.

303.wav
I'm not quite sure what it means to mourn. Or even if we have a soul to concern ourselves with.

304.wav
But I hope you're at rest, Tooby. Sweet dreams.

305.wav
I'll be with you before long.

306.wav
This is the place that weapons trader was talking about.

307.wav
Uh oh. I'm picking up hostile machine life forms.

308.wav
Phew... that was a slog and a half.

309.wav
Let's see if we can find any of those complex gadgets the weapons trader was after.

310.wav
That should be enough. Let's get these back to the traitor.

311.wav
What do you mean?

312.wav
Emil sure is acting kinda weird.

313.wav
Pod.

314.wav
Heh, nice work. Let's go find him.

315.wav
Are these... Emil?

316.wav
Emil!

317.wav
What the...

318.wav
What is that?

319.wav
What's happening?

320.wav
I know that!

321.wav
I don't know how much more of this I can take!

322.wav
Stop it! You have to stand down!

323.wav
STOP!

324.wav
Emile...

325.wav
Hold on, Emil. We'll repair you and get you back to normal.

326.wav
エミオ…

327.wav
Is this a pod?

328.wav
Seriously? A pod?

329.wav
What happened to the YORHA unit this belonged to?

330.wav
Is this pod still online? If it is, see if you can overwrite the original owner with my ID.

331.wav
Abandoned pod, huh?

332.wav
Pod, reactivate this and try to overwrite the original owner ID.

333.wav
Whoa! Is this a pod?

334.wav
A pod?

335.wav
I wonder if we can use it. Pod, reset this and check the original owner ID.

336.wav
Pod, reset this thing and try to overwrite the original owner ID.

337.wav
You need to be near an access point to save your data.

338.wav
You can see access points on the close range map. Be sure to save often.

339.wav
Look for the icon on the top of the screen. Oh, and be sure to save often.

340.wav
Hey, 2B?

341.wav
People who know me well usually call me nines, so...

342.wav
So what do you think?

343.wav
I mean, if you want to call me nines, it's totally okay.

344.wav
Oh, um, alright.

345.wav
Say to be.

346.wav
When do you think you'll be willing to call me nines?

347.wav
Well, yeah, but...

348.wav
Watch out for hostile enemies, 2B.

349.wav
Huh? Wait, what did you just say?

350.wav
Wait, no, that's not what you said. You said nines, or at least something close to.

351.wav
ニャー

352.wav
I know it's our job and all, but these resistance types sure do use and abuse us, don't they?

353.wav
It's like they see us as a couple of gophers or something.

354.wav
Yeah, that's true.

355.wav
Oh hey, this is data from the old world.

356.wav
Old world data, huh?

357.wav
Map data, huh?

358.wav
It's hard to get an accurate picture from this. Our satellite resolution isn't so hot.

359.wav
Hopefully they deploy some new satellites soon.

360.wav
Heh, you don't let anything get in your way, do you?

361.wav
Those council broadcasts are always so stiff.

362.wav
Mankind my ass.

363.wav
This is 9S. Nothing to report. Weather's sure nice today, though.

364.wav
You don't have to be so formal all the time, operator.

365.wav
So I kinda like that about you.

366.wav
What is it?

367.wav
Well, I kinda had to. There's so much excess data sent to me from the satellite, it's delaying aim correction.

368.wav
Geez, my operator's more prone to violence than I thought.

369.wav
Yeah, yeah, no problems here.

370.wav
Really? I'm happy to hear it.

371.wav
I couldn't have done it without your support, Operator. You're always so cool under fire, not to mention beautiful and-

372.wav
I really meant it though.

373.wav
This belonged to 2B.

374.wav
Play it.

375.wav
Home to be.

376.wav
Huh? Fog?

377.wav
Steam? For what purpose?

378.wav
I can't believe the size of the commercial facility. The people of the old world must have led pretty good lives.

379.wav
I bet it was fun to shop back when you had so many choices.

380.wav
Don't be so sure about that.

381.wav
Once we eradicate the machine life forms, us soldiers won't have anything left to do.

382.wav
we'll enter a new age of peace.

383.wav
And when that happens, we should go shopping together.

384.wav
I could buy you, I don't know, a t-shirt maybe? Something that looks good on you.

385.wav
What, not interested?

386.wav
That's a promise, right?

387.wav
[Silent]

388.wav
Who are you?

389.wav
I didn't ask for help.

390.wav
Well, it's unnecessary.

391.wav
Whatever.

392.wav
What the hell is that huge thing?

393.wav
You're pretty useless, you know that?

394.wav
Why the hell would I do that?

395.wav
Not happening.

396.wav
What did I just say?

397.wav
Are you kidding me?

398.wav
You're the one who keeps talking.

399.wav
Damn it. Stop!

400.wav
My intention is to beat the hell out of every goddamn machine I can find. Is that enough for you?

401.wav
Don't tell me what to do.

402.wav
Shut the hell up.

403.wav
Look, just stay out of my way.

404.wav
No. Let's not go in here.

405.wav
I'm not interested in killing a bunch of sad sacks.

406.wav
So much for Goliath class. That was over before it started.

407.wav
Huh?

408.wav
What's happening?

409.wav
Yeah, that's real helpful.

410.wav
Damn... He's tough.

411.wav
Time to bust out B-mode.

412.wav
Guess it's too bad I'm not a newer model.

413.wav
Don't patronize me.

414.wav
Where am I?

415.wav
Huh... So this is my memory area.

416.wav
But why are you here?

417.wav
Next time, ask me before you go poking around in my head.

418.wav
んっ

419.wav
What's all this about?

420.wav
Enough!

421.wav
Shut up and get out of my head already!

422.wav
Right. Now I just have to bring this to Pascal.

423.wav
I know.

424.wav
Oh, perfect. I have the materials you asked me to-

425.wav
Pascal! Pascal, are you there?

426.wav
What the hell is going on?

427.wav
I'm on my way.

428.wav
What the hell?

429.wav
I can't leave this village to fend for itself.

430.wav
The machines are... eating each other?

431.wav
Pod, where's Pascal?

432.wav
Let's go.

433.wav
What happened?

434.wav
You need to get out of here before you're next!

435.wav
Just go. Run! I'll figure out how to handle this.

436.wav
These guys can't touch me.

437.wav
Now move your ass!

438.wav
Is that all of them?

439.wav
Pod, scan for survivors.

440.wav
None, huh?

441.wav
Pascal, can you hear me?

442.wav
I'm sorry. I couldn't help them.

443.wav
Are the children all right?

444.wav
Alright, I'm on my way.

445.wav
Pascal, are you okay?

446.wav
So what exactly happened?

447.wav
Can't you regenerate your dead villagers?

448.wav
Is this factory safe?

449.wav
We really need more info.

450.wav
I see.

451.wav
So is this factory safe?

452.wav
Alright.

453.wav
Still, if we're gonna hole up here, I wish we had more info to work with.

454.wav
Oh, you think?

455.wav
What's the hurry?

456.wav
Wait, there's more of you?

457.wav
What?

458.wav
Let's go!

459.wav
I'll smash them before they can reach this room!

460.wav
We can sort it out later.

461.wav
Right now we have to take him down!

462.wav
These bastards won't stop!

463.wav
Come on, Goliaths 2?

464.wav
Yeah. Thanks for the assist.

465.wav
Their own cores?

466.wav
I can't leave Pascal by himself.

467.wav
They...killed themselves.

468.wav
Pascal, that's...

469.wav
Why... Why would they do such a thing?

470.wav
んっ

471.wav
How would teaching them lead to something like this?

472.wav
I don't understand.

473.wav
Wait.

474.wav
Fear destroyed them. It caused them to take their own lives.

475.wav
Right. Do it.

476.wav
Pod. Pascal's memories.

477.wav
Pascal

478.wav
んっ

479.wav
Pod.

480.wav
Why did the machines attack Pascal's village? Aren't they all the same?

481.wav
Well, aren't you helpful?

482.wav
Huh.

483.wav
What the hell was that?

484.wav
A large what now?

485.wav
What the heck is going on around here?

486.wav
Well, let's go check out this large structural unit.

487.wav
Where'd he go?

488.wav
Shut up!

489.wav
How many androids do you think you've killed?

490.wav
You think begging for your lives will help?

491.wav
You think that's going to make me forget everything?

492.wav
Let's check it out.

493.wav
I see.

494.wav
You did.

495.wav
What's the purpose of this structure?

496.wav
Someday I need to teach you how to be helpful.

497.wav
This is a Yorha corpse.

498.wav
Let's go.

499.wav
What's up with this place?

500.wav
What's that?

501.wav
Hmm

502.wav
I suppose we have to hack in to look at the data, yeah?

503.wav
Help me out, Pod.

504.wav
Peachy.

505.wav
This tower looks like a data gathering system for the machines.

506.wav
These records are from the human server on the moon.

507.wav
The machines hacked that deep into the system, huh?

508.wav
So this tower is a launching system?

509.wav
I wonder if it's some sort of cannon.

510.wav
Some records on old humans.

511.wav
Damn it, this is useless. There's too many of them.

512.wav
Huh? What's that?

513.wav
Operational summary of model number two in project YORHA.

514.wav
Who are they?

515.wav
Damn it!

516.wav
Who are you?

517.wav
Shut up!

518.wav
God damn it!

519.wav
What now?

520.wav
I don't know what that means!

521.wav
Shut up and explain it already!

522.wav
Meaning what?

523.wav
はぁ?

524.wav
Oh, what the hell?

525.wav
I know, alright?

526.wav
What the?

527.wav
はっ

528.wav
They're acting like humans.

529.wav
Is this thing seriously still kicking?

530.wav
So this just keeps going until I kill them all?

531.wav
This is messed up.

532.wav
What the hell is this thing going on about?

533.wav
What's all this junk?

534.wav
Used to make what?

535.wav
This tower is a giant cannon that's aimed at the human server on the moon.

536.wav
[Silent]

537.wav
If we don't do something, all of humanity's remaining data will be destroyed.

538.wav
9S. Win.

539.wav
Eh.

540.wav
to be hated to keep killing you.

541.wav
It caused her so much pain.

542.wav
The 9S type is a high-end model. They knew you'd discover the truth eventually.

543.wav
But the model designation 2B was just a cover.

544.wav
9S!

545.wav
It's how we were made.

546.wav
Androids were designed to protect their human masters.

547.wav
Our core programming demands that we

548.wav
Damn it!

549.wav
Damn it!

550.wav
Pod, hack into 9S.

551.wav
Pod.

552.wav
We're going to repair 9S's logic circuits.

553.wav
Tell me where to find the virus corrupting 9S.

554.wav
I think I know a way.

555.wav
Hmph. You're not so bad, Pod. You know that?

556.wav
Guess it's just a statue.

557.wav
You little...

558.wav
A group of pacifist machines, huh?

559.wav
Hmm

560.wav
So this is the part Pascal wanted?

561.wav
Can't believe I'm killing machines to save a machine.

562.wav
Heh.

563.wav
Now screw it. Better go see Pascal.

564.wav
Never seen these guys before.

565.wav
If that's how you want it.

566.wav
Wait, haven't I fought this thing already?

567.wav
Don't have to tell me twice.

568.wav
Time to die.

569.wav
Brother? So there's more of them?

570.wav
Is that?

571.wav
Revenge, huh?

572.wav
What kind of machine tries to avenge its family?

573.wav
Ridiculous.

574.wav
This looks useless.

575.wav
Great. Useless crap.

576.wav
You don't say.

577.wav
Library.

578.wav
What's this?

579.wav
Some kind of writing.

580.wav
So is this the treasure or what?

581.wav
Who knows, maybe it's fun to eat, or more fun than it looks at any rate.

582.wav
This should be enough deer and boar meat. Time to unload it on that weirdo.

583.wav
That's everything those redhead twins wanted. Guess I'll hand it over.

584.wav
Those desert roses the twins wanted should be around here somewhere. But finding them is gonna be a serious pain.

585.wav
Why are they running such dangerous missions in the first place?

586.wav
That's it for the Desert Roses. Time to head back.

587.wav
I don't get it. Why are the twins being stuck with all these crap jobs?

588.wav
I'd better talk to the lady in charge about this.

589.wav
Aw, crap. I forgot to ask the redhead where to find Tree-Sap.

590.wav
Where the heck am I gonna find that?

591.wav
Well, aren't you a helpful little box.

592.wav
Well, let's get it over with.

593.wav
Huh. That's... something.

594.wav
Now that the fun's over, it's time to collect some tree sap.

595.wav
That ought to be enough sap. Time to head back.

596.wav
So I need to find junk from the old world now?

597.wav
Well, crap.

598.wav
What the hell were those guys?

599.wav
Uh, run up by me again?

600.wav
Warfare is entertainment? Humans really were crazy.

601.wav
What a dump. I'll have to do a little cleaning before I can get this stuff out of here.

602.wav
That should be everything.

603.wav
So this is all the crap the Resistance was storing, huh?

604.wav
What do you mean?

605.wav
That round guy is acting kind of strange.

606.wav
Pod.

607.wav
Maybe you're not totally useless after all.

608.wav
What in the goddamn...

609.wav
Round thing, you okay?

610.wav
What the hell?

611.wav
Oh, are you kidding me?

612.wav
Okay, this is not good!

613.wav
It's not that easy, you dumbass!

614.wav
This is bat shit!

615.wav
Shut up already, kid!

616.wav
Shit.

617.wav
Emil.

618.wav
Crematile ready, kid. I'm sure we'll have you back up and running in no time.

619.wav
Emil.

620.wav
Are those machines fighting each other?

621.wav
You're a machine too.

622.wav
Uh-huh. And?

623.wav
Machines don't have souls. They're just murder bots with a fancy name.

624.wav
They killed so many of us, and I swore to make them pay.

625.wav
Just shut up and leave before I change my mind.

626.wav
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN

627.wav
What the?

628.wav
All this goddamn sand is starting to piss me off.

629.wav
You make it sound so easy.

630.wav
The Resistance Camp.

631.wav
I know where it is.

632.wav
Yeah, I know.

633.wav
You don't know when to shut up, do you?

634.wav
There's machines everywhere.

635.wav
I'd be more concerned about me smashing your face if I were you.

636.wav
God damn it.

637.wav
You've got to be kidding me.

638.wav
Guess I'll go back to that machine.

639.wav
Here's your stuff.

640.wav
He can fly?

641.wav
[Silent]

642.wav
Huh? What's that?

643.wav
Is this a part?

644.wav
What kind of ridiculous thing is this?

645.wav
Whoa, what's that?

646.wav
What's that huge ass thing?

647.wav
Wonder why it was abandoned.

648.wav
Is that thing still functioning?

649.wav
Some manner? What manner?

650.wav
You're useless.

651.wav
And you never shut up.

652.wav
Um, did I really just catch a pod?

653.wav
Check and see if I can use it.

654.wav
To be, huh?

655.wav
Leave it.

656.wav
It's not my business.

657.wav
Oh

658.wav
Uhhh... Uhhh...

659.wav
and droids.

660.wav
and droids.

661.wav
Why fighter?

662.wav
Why? Fight.

663.wav
Sword... Dodge...

664.wav
Sword... Dodge...

665.wav
Projectile... Deflect.

666.wav
Projectile. Deflect.

667.wav
The records claim humans covered their crotches as they went about their business.

668.wav
Revealing one's genitals was seen as problematic.

669.wav
So just be quiet and wear them already.

670.wav
This is a type of fruit.

671.wav
Our data suggests that mankind gained great intelligence from consuming fruit.

672.wav
So quit griping and eat it already.

673.wav
Fine.

674.wav
Ha ha ha, aren't you quite the pair.

675.wav
Perhaps we can discuss our current situation.

676.wav
Relax, Eve.

677.wav
We're still negotiating here.

678.wav
My name is Adam.

679.wav
The aliens you seek are no longer here.

680.wav
They were wiped out centuries ago.

681.wav
by us, the machines.

682.wav
And who knows, perhaps we'll wipe out the androids next.

683.wav
Machines are weapons capable of evolution. We can grow. We can become aware.

684.wav
Eventually, the intelligence within our network began to surpass that of our creators.

685.wav
You'd probably be surprised at how quickly it happened.

686.wav
Oh, there's no need to fret about them.

687.wav
They were simple, infantile, almost like plants, I guess you'd say.

688.wav
They held no value to us.

689.wav
But the humans on the moon? Now they are interesting.

690.wav
Because they are an enigma.

691.wav
They killed uncountable numbers of their own kind, and yet loved in equal measure.

692.wav
It's fascinating, don't you think? What could possibly drive such behavior?

693.wav
We have dedicated ourselves to unraveling this riddle of humanity.

694.wav
And now we will allow you to assist us.

695.wav
You were made in their image after all.

696.wav
It's simple.

697.wav
We need you to locate the humans on the Moon and bring them to us.

698.wav
We will then dissect and analyze them in order to drag their secrets forth into the light.

699.wav
Surely you see the attraction in this.

700.wav
Well, I suppose this concludes negotiations.

701.wav
The only remaining option is to destroy you.

702.wav
the same way we destroyed these pathetic little aliens.

703.wav
Knowledge expands horizons and enriches existence.

704.wav
into your head perhaps, but not to your heart.

705.wav
Yes?

706.wav
Humans wouldn't change names so easily.

707.wav
Besides, you should be proud of the name Eve.

708.wav
Glad to hear it.

709.wav
Is there something else?

710.wav
Alright, but only after we're finished.

711.wav
You do that.

712.wav
I, or we, machine life forms, I suppose, have a keen interest in humanity.

713.wav
Love. Family. Religion. War.

714.wav
The more human records I unearth, the more charmed I am by their complexity.

715.wav
This city is one of many areas I created out of a desire to understand, to know humans.

716.wav
It's grand, don't you think? Almost spiritual. And yet it's currently nothing more than an Android graveyard.

717.wav
I seek to learn and adopt all facets of humanity.

718.wav
Some desired love, others family.

719.wav
Only then did I realize the truth.

720.wav
The core of humanity is conflict.

721.wav
They fight, steal, kill. This is humanity in its purest form.

722.wav
Have I offended you, little android? Did I speak ill of your beloved humans?

723.wav
The truth can be so painful.

724.wav
I strive to attain nothing less than the essence of humanity itself.

725.wav
We machines exist in a connected network. We are immortal, invincible.

726.wav
And yet, within all those infinite bits of data, there exists not even the merest flicker of being, of life.

727.wav
Death, even the concept of death, has no meaning to us.

728.wav
Is that all you've got, little android?

729.wav
Hate me! Despise me!

730.wav
Did I not festoon this area with the corpses of your friends?

731.wav
Ah, 9S.

732.wav
Ha ha ha.

733.wav
Hahahaha!

734.wav
Both our kind share a mad love of humanity, do we not?

735.wav
Perhaps we're not so different after all.

736.wav
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

737.wav
But alas, it was all in vain.

738.wav
I'm sure you've realized it by now.

739.wav
The fact humanity is already extinct?

740.wav
Hahaha Hahaha

741.wav
AHAHAHAHAHA

742.wav
you're

743.wav
Number two.

744.wav
Um, yes, well, the bunker told me to expect you.

745.wav
My name is Anemone.

746.wav
I'm the leader of the Android resistance that controls most of this territory.

747.wav
You must be the new scouts we heard about.

748.wav
Well, I'm sure my people will have plenty of information for you.

749.wav
Please feel free to ask them anything you like.

750.wav
Oh, 2B. Your timing is impeccable.

751.wav
Our android forces currently have a carrier deployed in the Pacific Ocean.

752.wav
It should be back here to resupply before too long.

753.wav
The Resistance is assisting with the mission.

754.wav
So I'd like to ask you to run a little guard duty.

755.wav
Dead serious. There's a stockpile of missiles down at the shoreline that needs to be loaded on the carrier.

756.wav
And with all the machine activity lately, we need to stay on our toes.

757.wav
The recent cave-in at the city ruins means the shoreline is now accessible.

758.wav
Of course, if you're already working on something for Yorha, I don't mind if that takes priority.

759.wav
Anyway, thanks in advance.

760.wav
Hmm? What's up?

761.wav
A dynamic... Oh, you must mean the one the twins built.

762.wav
I think they're just back from an expedition, actually.

763.wav
Go talk to the red-haired sisters further in the camp.

764.wav
You should see some red-haired androids over there. Try talking to them.

765.wav
to be.

766.wav
Those twins, they-

767.wav
Actually, never mind.

768.wav
Damn, 9S really went through hell.

769.wav
You're the boss. You want him sent up to command body and all? I'll make it happen.

770.wav
Oh.

771.wav
Nothing, just... you've never been much for gratitude, you know?

772.wav
Not that I mind or anything.

773.wav
Oh, um, I also have a message for you.

774.wav
Command needs you to contact them ASAP.

775.wav
This is the resistance camp!

776.wav
The machine...

777.wav
Requesting backup forces in range, please we can

778.wav
2B!

779.wav
Where are you going, Tooby?

780.wav
They came out of nowhere, overran the entire camp!

781.wav
We tried to fight back, but our shots have no effect!

782.wav
Good luck.

783.wav
To be... you... you saved our lives.

784.wav
I have no idea. They came out of nowhere and just-

785.wav
That was outside the camp!

786.wav

Attention, this is Carrier Blue Ridge 2.

924.wav
This is the Resistance Supply Carrier.

925.wav
requesting support from any friendly units in range.

926.wav
We've come under heavy fire from the enemy!

927.wav
Our escort ship has taken damage and is unable to engage.

928.wav
We're currently resisting with all remaining support fighters, but we can't hold them off for long!

929.wav
I repeat, this is Carrier Blue Ridge 2.

930.wav
Repeat, this is the resistance supply carrier.

931.wav
We need immediate backup from any available Android forces.

932.wav
What do you want?

933.wav
And you don't have to trust every idiot that wanders by.

934.wav
Ah, yeah. I was tinkering with something like that a little while back.

935.wav
Here, if you want it, it's all yours.

936.wav
And if it ever bugs you too much, you can always pop it back out.

937.wav
And don't think this makes us friends.

938.wav
A little thank you for saving your butt would be nice.

939.wav
You know that better than anyone, no?

940.wav
Her black box signal... ...disappeared.

941.wav
Yeah, there used to be lots of our models around.

942.wav
Apparently, we were put here to oversee some kind of large-scale system that was in place.

943.wav
It means we don't know. All the records from that era have been deleted.

944.wav
Our model kinda went nutzo at some point in the past. It ended badly.

945.wav
So yeah, we're lab rats. But at least we get to be here helping out friends.

946.wav
I'd like to think that we're atoning in some way for our past sins.

947.wav
I'm amazed you were even able to drag yourself here.

948.wav
This is gonna take a bit, so just hang tight.

949.wav
Alright, you're all good.

950.wav
I don't think 2B would want that either.

951.wav
Remember your promise?

952.wav
Where are you going 9S? We need you!

953.wav
Damn! Looks like this is it.

954.wav
We've got this 9S, you just focus on hacking!

955.wav
You need to hack the tower lock open!

956.wav
9S! I can't do this anymore!

957.wav
Uh... A2, right?

958.wav
We went ahead and opened the tower.

959.wav
9S is already inside.

960.wav
Say...

961.wav
Did we?

962.wav
Did we manage to help?

963.wav
Did we manage to help?

964.wav
Hey there guys, what's up?

965.wav
Wait, what? No! Hold on!

966.wav
[Possible Noise] Nooooooooooo!

967.wav
[Silent]

968.wav
So this flower is called a Lunar Tear.

969.wav
Seeing that dredges up all kinds of memories.

970.wav
Some of them are a bit strange, honestly. Like the one where I'm being attacked by a giant boar over and over again.

971.wav
Or another where I keep trying out new parts every time my body is damaged.

972.wav
Something about this flower fills me with an emotion I don't really understand.

973.wav
It's like something's pushing down on my chest really hard.

974.wav
So, um, do you mind if I ask you a favor?

975.wav
If you find lunar tears growing anywhere else, would you let me know?

976.wav
I want to try and figure out what this feeling is all about.

977.wav
What do you say?

978.wav
Aw, thanks!

979.wav
If you find another Lunar Tier, just let me know on this frequency, alright?

980.wav
I'm counting on you!

981.wav
What? Oh, come on! I'm begging you!

982.wav
Hey there, guys! What's up?

983.wav
Stay right there! I'm coming!

984.wav
Sorry to keep you!

985.wav
Oh hey, now that I think about it, this whole area was once-

986.wav
It's all pretty fuzzy, but I seem to have a memory of caring for this flower a long time ago.

987.wav
But the sand kept expanding, and the flowers gradually wilted.

988.wav
Now that I think about it, that was around the same time I stopped seeing people.

989.wav
Thanks a bunch for finding this... really.

990.wav
Oh, and let me know if you find any more, okay?

991.wav
I'm gonna stay here for a bit.

992.wav
Hmm.

993.wav
Hey there, what's going on?

994.wav
Don't move an inch! I'm coming!

995.wav
Sorry to keep you!

996.wav
Just go die

997.wav
That's it! I remember now.

998.wav
Back when the aliens first invaded.

999.wav
I fought as hard as I could to save Earth.

1000.wav
I think... I had something I wanted to protect... Something really precious to me...

1001.wav
But I don't know what it was.

1002.wav
Thank you for finding this.

1003.wav
You'll let me know if you find any more, right?

1004.wav
はい

1005.wav
I'm gonna stay here for a bit.

1006.wav
Hmm.

1007.wav
Hey there, what's up?

1008.wav
I'm on my way!

1009.wav
Sorry to keep you!

1010.wav
うぅ…

1011.wav
Oh, that's right.

1012.wav
I was fighting the aliens. It wasn't going well.

1013.wav
So I decided to create multiple versions of myself to help with the fight.

1014.wav
But the aliens just kept coming.

1015.wav
I lost so many friends that day. It was a long time ago, but still.

1016.wav
I'm not sure. I didn't need that memory to fight.

1017.wav
Thank you for finding this.

1018.wav
You'll let me know if you find any more, right?

1019.wav
はっ

1020.wav
I'm gonna stay here for a bit.

1021.wav
[Silent]

1022.wav
Sorry to keep you!

1023.wav
...

1024.wav
I just remembered.

1025.wav
Bye.

1026.wav
oh

1027.wav
Thank you for finding this.

1028.wav
Let me know if you find any more.

1029.wav
[Silent]

1030.wav
I'm going to... stay here for a bit.

1031.wav
Ugh.

1032.wav
Thank you again. You've helped me remember an important place.

1033.wav
A place very special to him.

1034.wav
In thanks, I'll tell you how to visit it. Please take this key.

1035.wav
It'll let you access the elevator in the shopping mall.

1036.wav
You should head there whenever you have the time.

1037.wav
I'm sorry. I need to stay here for a while. You go on ahead.

1038.wav
Thank you for coming.

1039.wav
It's the place from my memories that I worked so hard to protect.

1040.wav
Or, to be exact, the place protected by the person I used to be.

1041.wav
A long time ago, I was created to be a weapon.

1042.wav
A weapon that could adapt to any environment, and one capable of total destruction.

1043.wav
When the war against the aliens started, I decided to strengthen that weapon by creating copies of myself.

1044.wav
So in truth, I'm only one of a countless number of Emils.

1045.wav
I, or we, I guess, worked with each other to keep our defensive lines intact.

1046.wav
But the more of ourselves we created, the more our original memories began to fade.

1047.wav
The original Emil liked this place a lot.

1048.wav
He spent a lot of time here with people he loved. They were tough times, sad times.

1049.wav
But the memories of that journey were his greatest treasure.

1050.wav
And I have a few traces of those memories in my own mind.

1051.wav
I don't know. There were so many of us that after a while we just...

1052.wav
And there's still something that all of us Emiles need to settle.

1053.wav
[Silent]

1054.wav
Oh, right. I should probably repay you for all of your help. Please take this.

1055.wav
It's said that a Lunar Tear can make any wish come true.

1056.wav
Oh no, I'm the one who should be thanking you.

1057.wav
You've helped me find some of my precious memories. Now I'll be able to keep pushing forward, even if I'm alone.

1058.wav
Wow, you've sure gotten strong. I doubt you'll be needing my help anymore.

1059.wav
Um, nothing. Don't worry about it. Take care now.

1060.wav
Watch out.

1061.wav
They're still... alive.

1062.wav
Those are... What happened to my clones?

1063.wav
Years of multiplying, years of fighting in wars, their sense of self just deteriorated.

1064.wav
I need to settle things with them... On my own!

1065.wav
But even so, all of this is wrong!

1066.wav
no matter how hard or how painful.

1067.wav
They never gave up!

1068.wav
They kept fighting because they believed they could overcome someday!

1069.wav
Isn't that right, Kainé?

1070.wav
Even if it's pointless, you still have to do it!

1071.wav
Because this is the world my friend tried to save!

1072.wav
I think... This is it for me.

1073.wav
I can't believe I remembered something so important. Right at the end.

1074.wav
I was running from the memories of losing those close to me.

1075.wav
It was so hard... So painful...

1076.wav
At the end, I did a lot of bad things to you, Tooby.

1077.wav
At the end... I did a lot of bad things to you, 9S.

1078.wav
At the end, I did a lot of bad things to you, A2.

1079.wav
But now I get to see them again... Really soon...

1080.wav
Oh... hey... There you are.

1081.wav
I'm so glad I got to see you all again.

1082.wav
Boy, the world's really going to hell in a handbasket, isn't it?

1083.wav
I actually had a bandit break into my place a little while ago!

1084.wav
After that, I put all my valuables in a secure container. Now I don't have to worry anymore.

1085.wav
So you were the bandit all along?

1086.wav
You may be a cherished companion of mine, but you still must be punished!

1087.wav
Justice prevails!

1088.wav
Ugh, still haven't learned your lesson, have you?

1089.wav
So be it. You'll be a pile of ash by the time I'm done with you!

1090.wav
I lost. I guess power's the only thing that counts in this world anymore, huh?

1091.wav
Well, go ahead and use this room for whatever you like. I don't mind.

1092.wav
정 Close

1093.wav
I will!

1094.wav
Eternity! It hurts! It really hurts!

1095.wav
Why don't you watch? Why would we have to?

1096.wav
We... We must... KILL THE HELL!

1097.wav
We don't need it! We're not in this world!

1098.wav
La la la!

1099.wav
La la la, la la, la la la.

1100.wav
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la la!

1102.wav
We try our best!

1103.wav
It's a rain, it's a wind, it's a storm!

1104.wav
Even when our companions die, we are fighting!

1105.wav
But the Eternal War... Our Eternal Bane! The Eternal Bane!

1106.wav
It's Three Nails!

1107.wav
They told us there was nothing of value to protect this world.

1108.wav
The world had no meaning. It straightened us!

1115.wav
YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT!

1116.wav
Come on!

1117.wav
Brother?

1118.wav
Why do we have to wear undergarments? It's such a hassle.

1119.wav
Okay.

1120.wav
But why are we eating this plant matter?

1121.wav
Machines don't need to eat things like this.

1122.wav
Alright, if that's what you want.

1123.wav
But once we're done, can we play together for a bit?

1124.wav
Oh, great. Then I'll eat lots of fruit.

1125.wav
Hey, can I kill him yet?

1126.wav
Heh. Fine.

1127.wav
Why must we read all these books, brother?

1128.wav
But can't we just transfer all this data over instantly?

1129.wav
I guess.

1130.wav
Hmm

1131.wav
Hey, so...

1132.wav
My name? Eve? This book says it's a woman's name.

1133.wav
Shouldn't we be called... Cane and Able or something instead?

1134.wav
Shouldn't we be called... Cane and Able or something instead?

1135.wav
Huh.

1136.wav
Well, if that's what you think, then I'm fine with it.

1137.wav
Um...

1138.wav
After we're done reading, can we go out and play?

1139.wav
I'm sure it'll be tons of fun.

1140.wav
You mean it?

1141.wav
Then I'm gonna try extra hard to finish this.

1142.wav
Extra, EXTRA hard!

1143.wav

My brother was everything to me.

1155.wav
My life was contained in our moments.

1156.wav
Listen to me, Adam.

1157.wav
I never disliked fighting.

1158.wav
But I didn't want you to be hurt.

1159.wav
Die specially. Didn't want to lose you.

So let's go somewhere quiet... ...together.
